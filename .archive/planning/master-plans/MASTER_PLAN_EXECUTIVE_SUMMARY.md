## 💡 Key Decisions to Make

### 1. Scope Decision
**Question**: Which option do you want?

- **Option A (MVP)**: Document + monitor + 1 agent (47-65h)
- **Option B (Production)**: Above + 4 critical agents (97-139h)
- **Option C (Complete)**: All 11 agents + memory + deploy (260-380h)

**Recommendation**: Start with Option B (Production Ready), then decide

### 2. Execution Strategy
**Question**: How to execute?

- **Sequential Blocks**: One block at a time (safest, recommended)
- **Parallel Tasks**: Multiple agents can work in parallel (faster, riskier)
- **Hybrid**: Sequential blocks, parallel tasks within blocks

**Recommendation**: Sequential blocks with parallel tasks in Phases 7-15

### 3. Starting Priority
**Question**: Start with Phase 1 (docs) or Phase 4 (monitoring)?

- **Phase 1 First**: Document current system (2-3h), THEN add monitoring
- **Phase 4 First**: Add monitoring/quality NOW, document later

**Recommendation**: Phase 1 first (only 2-3 hours, huge value)

## 🎓 Lessons from Phase 4

**What Worked**:
✅ Parallel execution (fan-out/fan-in)
✅ Custom reducers (merge_dicts, add_tokens)
✅ Quality iteration loop
✅ Specialist agents (Financial, Market, Product)

**What Needs Improvement**:
⚠️ Documentation (zero docs)
⚠️ Monitoring (blind execution)
⚠️ Quality (67% vs 85% target)
⚠️ Cost ($0.08 vs $0.05 target)
⚠️ Memory (stateless, redundant searches)

**This Plan Addresses All Gaps** while preserving what works.
