# Paraguay - Energy Sector
# STRATEGIC SECTOR - World's Largest Hydroelectric Per Capita

sector:
  name: "Energy & Hydroelectric"
  code: "ENE"
  country: "paraguay"
  priority: P1_critical

  description: |
    Paraguay is uniquely positioned in global energy with massive hydroelectric
    capacity from Itaipu (world's 2nd largest dam) and Yacyreta. The country
    exports ~85% of its electricity, primarily to Brazil and Argentina, and has
    the LOWEST electricity costs in the region - creating massive opportunities
    for energy-intensive industries, green hydrogen, and data centers.
