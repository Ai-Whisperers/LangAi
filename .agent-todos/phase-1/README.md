# Phase 1: Basic Research Loop with LangGraph

**Timeline:** Weeks 2-3 (10-14 days)
**Goal:** Refactor hello_research.py into proper LangGraph workflow
**Status:** [ ] Not Started
**Prerequisites:** Phase 0 Complete

## Overview

Take the working `hello_research.py` script and transform it into a proper LangGraph workflow with:
- State management using dataclasses
- Node-based workflow architecture
- Quality reflection loop
- Proper error handling
- Unit tests

## Tasks

| # | Task | File | Status | Est Time |

| 1 | Define State Schemas | 01-state-management.md | [ ] | 3h |
| 2 | Build LangGraph Workflow | 02-langgraph-workflow.md | [ ] | 5h |
| 3 | Integrate Search Tools | 03-search-integration.md | [ ] | 4h |
| 4 | Implement Data Extraction | 04-extraction.md | [ ] | 4h |
| 5 | Add Quality Reflection Loop | 05-quality-loop.md | [ ] | 5h |
| 6 | Generate Structured Reports | 06-report-generation.md | [ ] | 3h |

**Total Estimated:** 24 hours
