# Roadmap

This folder captures **what we want to build next**, plus design notes and implementation plans.

If you’re new, start here:

1. `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` — what’s implemented vs planned
2. `PARALLEL_WORKSTREAMS.md` — suggested parallel work tracks
3. `TECHNOLOGY_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` — platform-level improvements (performance, reliability)
