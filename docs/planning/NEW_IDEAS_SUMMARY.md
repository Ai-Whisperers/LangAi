## 💡 Key Insights from External Repos

### 1. Company-researcher Showed Us:
✅ **Pipeline > LangGraph** for complex workflows
✅ **14 specialists > 1 generalist** for quality
✅ **Tool singletons** save 50% memory
✅ **Custom errors** enable graceful degradation
✅ **Quality scoring** is essential for trust

### 2. langchain-reference Taught Us:
✅ **3-phase workflow** (Search → Extract → Reflect) works
✅ **Multi-model routing** saves 30-40% on costs
✅ **Dual-layer memory** (hot + cold) is the pattern
✅ **Context engineering** (WRITE/SELECT/COMPRESS/ISOLATE)
✅ **Supervisor pattern** for multi-agent coordination

### 3. agentops Demonstrated:
✅ **Decorator-based tracking** is elegant
✅ **Session replay** is critical for debugging
✅ **Cost tracking** should be automatic
✅ **Real-time monitoring** prevents issues

### 4. Best Practices Emerged:
✅ **Start simple, build up** (don't add all 159 at once)
✅ **Extract patterns, not code** (adapt to your architecture)
✅ **Test thoroughly** before moving on
✅ **Document as you go** (future you will thank you)
✅ **Focus on business value** (not cool features)
