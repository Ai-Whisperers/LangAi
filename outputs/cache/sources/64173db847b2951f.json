Tigo Paraguay began testing its 3G network in July 2007, with the infrastructure provided by the Chinese manufacturer Huawei. As of December 2024, Tigo had not announced any plans to shut down its 3G network, although the focus has shifted towards expanding 4G and preparing for 5G technologies. Tigo Paraguay launched its 4G LTE network in April 2016, using the AWS spectrum. In December 2015, Paraguay's National Telecommunications Council (CONATEL) approved Tigo's application for a 4G license, which included a payment of USD 45 million for three sub-band blocks. As of 2024, Tigo Paraguay had not yet launched commercial 5G services. In 2021, Tigo and Claro pledged a combined investment of USD 47 million in network upgrades as part of the renewal of their 4G licenses, which also included preparations for 5G deployment.",
