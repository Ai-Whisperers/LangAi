        "content": "Millicom International Cellular S.A. is a Luxembourg-headquartered telecommunications company founded in 1990, specializing in mobile, fixed-line broadband, cable television, and digital financial services across 11 countries in Latin America under the Tigo brand.[1][2] The company, which employs approximately 14,000 people as of March 2025, serves around 46 million mobile customers and passes 14 million homes with its fiber-cable network, focusing on emerging markets to deliver connectivity, entertainment, and fintech solutions like Tigo Money.[3][4] Its operations span Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, and Uruguay, following recent acquisitions of Telefónica's businesses in Ecuador and Uruguay in 2025 that expanded its footprint and enhanced revenue stability.[5] Originally established as a pioneer in mobile communications for developing regions, Millicom has evolved from early international expansions in Africa and Asia to a streamlined focus on Latin America after divesting its African operations by 2022, allowing greater investment in digital infrastructure and 5G rollout.[6][7] Key milestones include launching one of the world's first commercial mobile networks in 1989 and growing into a NASDAQ-listed entity (NASDAQ: TIGO) with a market emphasis on sustainable connectivity to bridge the digital divide.[8][9] Under CEO Marcelo Benítez since 2024, Millicom prioritizes ESG integration, targeting reduced leverage and expanded free cash flow generation amid competitive telecom landscapes.[1][10].",
