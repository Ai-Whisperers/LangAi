## Data Quality Assessment

**Confidence Level: 72/100**

**Strengths:**
- Strong qualitative information about company history, services, and market position
- Clear technology deployment timeline and infrastructure investments
- Verified regulatory developments (spectrum renewals, licenses)
- Parent company financial metrics available
- Customer base and coverage statistics provided
- Competitive landscape identified

**Data Gaps:**
- **Financial Performance (Critical):** No Paraguay-specific revenue, EBITDA, or profitability figures disclosed. Millicom reports consolidated results without country-level breakdowns in available sources.
- **Market Share Precision:** While described as "#1," exact market share percentages versus Personal and Claro not quantified
- **5G Timeline:** No specific commercial launch date or deployment schedule provided
- **Competitive Metrics:** Limited information on competitor customer bases, coverage, or service offerings for direct comparison
- **Recent Leadership:** Current General Manager status unclear (Jose Perdomo referenced in historical 25th anniversary context)
- **Tower Sale Details:** Transaction value and date for ATIS Group tower sale not specified
- **Tigo Money Financials:** Transaction volumes, revenue contribution, or growth rates not disclosed
- **Employee Count:** Paraguay-specific workforce size not provided (parent company: 14,000 across 11 countries)

**Reliability Notes:**
- Information synthesized from multiple credible sources (company announcements, regulatory filings, business databases)
- Some data points dated (25th anniversary celebration appears to reference 2016 timeframe)
- Parent company information (Millicom) more readily available than subsidiary-specific metrics
- No contradictory information found across sources, suggesting consistency

**Recommendations for Enhanced Analysis:**
- Access to Millicom investor presentations with country-level segment reporting
- CONATEL regulatory filings for market share data
- Industry analyst reports (GSMA, Ovum/Omdia) for competitive benchmarking
- Direct company financial statements if publicly filed in Paraguay
- Customer satisfaction and NPS scores for service quality assessment
