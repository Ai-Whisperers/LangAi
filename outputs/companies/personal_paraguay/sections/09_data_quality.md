## Data Quality Assessment

**Confidence Level: 62/100**

**Strengths:**
- Strong data on technology timeline and network evolution (3G launch 2008, 4G launch 2013, 5G planning)
- Detailed financial stress indicators and credit risk trends (2021-2025)
- Clear competitive landscape identification
- Confirmed corporate structure and parent company relationship
- Service portfolio comprehensively documented

**Significant Data Gaps:**

1. **Financial Metrics (Critical Gap):** No specific revenue figures, EBITDA, subscriber counts, market share percentages, or ARPU data available. This represents the most significant limitation for comprehensive analysis.

2. **Current Leadership (Major Gap):** No information on current CEO, CFO, or executive team. Only historical references to former employees found.

3. **Market Share Data (Major Gap):** While described as "one of the leading companies," no quantitative market position data available relative to Tigo and Claro.

4. **Subscriber Metrics (Major Gap):** No data on total subscriber base, growth rates, churn rates, or customer acquisition costs.

5. **Network Coverage (Moderate Gap):** No specific data on population coverage percentages, tower counts, or geographic reach metrics.

6. **Recent Financial Performance (Moderate Gap):** Credit risk data available through 2025, but no recent revenue, profit, or cash flow information.

7. **5G Timeline Specifics (Minor Gap):** General planning information available but no confirmed participation in spectrum auctions or deployment timeline.

**Data Reliability:**
- Information sourced from multiple independent sources showing consistency
- Technical data (frequencies, launch dates) appears reliable and specific
- Financial stress data from specialized credit analysis platform (martini.ai)
- Some sources are general business directories with limited depth

**Recommendations for Enhanced Analysis:**
- Access to Telecom Argentina S.A. consolidated financial statements for subsidiary performance
- CONATEL regulatory filings for market share and coverage data
- Industry analyst reports specific to Paraguayan telecommunications market
- Direct company communications or investor relations materials
- Subscriber and revenue data from market research firms (GSMA, Omdia, etc.)
