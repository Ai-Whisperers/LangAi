**Data Gaps and Limitations:**

1. **Competitor Information:** Limited specific data on Argentine domestic competitors; competitor list includes many international companies not directly comparable to Argentine market dynamics

2. **Market Share:** No specific market share percentages or ranking position within Argentina provided

3. **Complete Financial Statements:** Full balance sheet, cash flow statements, and detailed segment breakdowns not available in search results

4. **Historical Performance:** Limited long-term historical data; most information focuses on 2024-2025 period

5. **Geographic Details:** Headquarters city/location not specified; regional coverage within Argentina not detailed

6. **5G Deployment:** "Limited deployment" mentioned but no specifics on coverage, timeline, or investment amounts

7. **Customer Metrics:** Total customer base across all services not provided; only Flow subsidiary numbers available

8. **Ownership Structure:** Parent company listed as "N/A" but no detail on shareholder composition or major investors

9. **Revenue Breakdown:** Limited segment-level detail on revenue contribution by service line (mobile vs. fixed vs. broadband vs. TV)

10. **Strategic Plans:** Future guidance and multi-year strategic objectives not detailed in available sources

**Reliability Notes:**
- Financial data comes from official earnings calls and reports, providing high reliability
- Some inconsistency in currency reporting (ARS vs. USD) requires careful interpretation
- Inflation adjustments and "real terms" calculations are company-provided and methodology not fully transparent
- Recent data (2024-2025) is more comprehensive than historical information
