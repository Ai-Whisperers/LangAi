## Executive Summary

Tesla, Inc. is a vertically-integrated American manufacturer headquartered in Austin, Texas, that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles, energy generation and storage systems, and solar products globally. Founded as Tesla Motors to develop electric sports cars, the company has evolved into a multi-industry force under CEO Elon Musk's leadership, positioning itself as much as an AI and robotics company as an automotive manufacturer.

In 2024, Tesla generated $97.69 billion in total revenues, though the company faced significant profitability challenges with GAAP net income falling 53% to $7 billion from $15 billion in 2023 (adjusted for a one-time tax benefit). The automotive segment experienced headwinds with revenues declining 6% year-over-year, while the Energy Generation and Storage segment emerged as a bright spot with 67% revenue growth. The company maintains a strong market presence with 384,000 vehicle deliveries in Q2 2025 (up 29% year-over-year), extensive Supercharger infrastructure, and an expanding energy business that now contributes 15% of gross profit.

Despite financial pressures from aggressive pricing strategies and margin compression, Tesla continues to invest heavily in AI, autonomous driving technology, and manufacturing capacity, particularly in China. The company's lean executive structure and emphasis on vertical integration position it uniquely in the automotive and energy sectors, though leadership turnover and operational challenges present ongoing risks.
