## Data Quality Assessment

**Confidence Level: 62/100**

**Rationale for Rating:**

**Strengths of Available Data:**
- Clear technical specifications (frequency bands, network generations)
- Confirmed corporate structure and parent company relationship
- Verified competitive landscape (three main operators identified)
- Recent infrastructure updates documented (August 2024 band additions)
- 5G status and national plan framework confirmed as of December 2024
- Customer base structure (80/20 prepaid/postpaid split) provided

**Significant Data Gaps:**

1. **Financial Information (Critical Gap):** No specific revenue figures, EBITDA, profit margins, capital expenditure, or subscriber numbers available. This represents the most significant limitation for comprehensive business analysis.

2. **Market Share Data:** No quantitative market position data (percentage of subscribers, revenue share, or ranking among the three operators).

3. **Leadership Information:** Minimal information about executive team, management structure, or strategic decision-makers beyond operational role references.

4. **Historical Performance:** Limited time-series data on growth rates, subscriber trends, or financial trajectory.

5. **Detailed Service Pricing:** No information on tariff structures, ARPU, or competitive pricing dynamics.

6. **4G Launch Date:** While 4G network existence is confirmed, specific launch date not provided (only 3G launch date of November 2007 available).

7. **Coverage Metrics:** Qualitative descriptions ("extensive coverage") without quantitative population or geographic coverage percentages.

8. **New Entrant Status:** Nubicom/Remsa market entry mentioned but status unclear ("could be at risk" suggests uncertainty).

**Data Reliability:**
- Information appears consistent across multiple sources
- Technical specifications align with standard telecommunications practices
- Parent company relationship verifiable through multiple references
- Recent updates (December 2024, August 2024) suggest current information

**Recommendations for Enhanced Analysis:**
To increase confidence to 85-90%, the following additional data would be valuable:
- América Móvil financial reports with Paraguay segment breakdown
- CONATEL (Paraguayan telecom regulator) market statistics
- Subscriber and revenue market share data
- Detailed 5G deployment timeline and investment figures
- Competitive benchmarking data on network quality and customer satisfaction
