# Claro Paraguay - Research Report

## Executive Summary

AMX Paraguay S.A., operating under the Claro brand, is a major telecommunications provider in Paraguay and a subsidiary of América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V., one of Latin America's largest telecommunications conglomerates. Founded in 2008, Claro Paraguay has established itself as a significant player in the Paraguayan mobile telecommunications market, competing directly with Tigo Paraguay and Personal Paraguay.

The company operates a multi-generation network infrastructure, including 2G GSM, 3G UMTS (launched November 2007), and 4G LTE services across multiple frequency bands. With a customer base heavily weighted toward prepaid services (80% prepaid vs. 20% postpaid), Claro Paraguay reflects the typical market dynamics of developing telecommunications markets in Latin America. As of December 2024, the company has not yet launched commercial 5G services, though Paraguay's National Telecommunications Plan (PNT) 2021-2025 has laid the groundwork for future 5G deployment with the goal of covering half the population by 2025.

Claro Paraguay's network infrastructure utilizes strategic frequency bands including 1900 MHz for GSM and UMTS, and Bands 28 (700 MHz APT) and Band 4 (1700/2100 MHz AWS 1) for LTE, providing robust mobile data coverage across the country. The company offers comprehensive mobile services including international roaming within the Claro network across Latin America.

## Key Insights

1. **Technology Transition Phase:** Claro Paraguay is in a critical transition period, having matured its 4G LTE network (with recent band additions in August 2024) while preparing for 5G deployment. The company faces pressure to launch 5G services to meet the National Telecommunications Plan's 2025 target of 50% population coverage, putting it in a race with competitors to capture early 5G market share.

2. **Prepaid Market Dominance Shapes Business Model:** With 80% of customers on prepaid plans, Claro Paraguay operates in a high-volume, lower-ARPU environment typical of developing markets. This structure requires focus on customer acquisition, retention through value propositions, and strategies to migrate users toward higher-value postpaid and data services to improve revenue quality.

3. **Strategic Spectrum Portfolio:** The company's multi-band approach—combining 1900 MHz for legacy services, 700 MHz (Band 28) for wide-area coverage, 1700/2100 MHz (Band 4) for capacity, and allocated 3.5 GHz for future 5G—demonstrates sophisticated spectrum strategy balancing coverage economics with capacity needs, providing competitive advantage in network quality.

4. **América Móvil Backing Provides Competitive Edge:** As part of Latin America's largest telecommunications group, Claro Paraguay benefits from significant advantages including financial resources for network investment, regional roaming integration across 18 countries, technology partnerships (Ericsson), and operational best practices, positioning it strongly against competitors despite the challenging market dynamics.

5. **Market Disruption Risk from Potential New Entrant:** The 2024 announcement of Nubicom's agreement with Remsa (a mining and energy company) to potentially enter the market represents a significant strategic concern. A fourth operator could intensify price competition, fragment market share, and pressure margins in an already competitive three-player market, particularly if the new entrant pursues aggressive pricing or targets underserved segments.

## Data Quality Assessment

**Confidence Level: 62/100**

**Rationale for Rating:**

**Strengths of Available Data:**

3. **Leadership Information:** Minimal information about executive team, management structure, or strategic decision-makers beyond operational role references.

4. **Historical Performance:** Limited time-series data on growth rates, subscriber trends, or financial trajectory.

5. **Detailed Service Pricing:** No information on tariff structures, ARPU, or competitive pricing dynamics.

6. **4G Launch Date:** While 4G network existence is confirmed, specific launch date not provided (only 3G launch date of November 2007 available).

7. **Coverage Metrics:** Qualitative descriptions ("extensive coverage") without quantitative population or geographic coverage percentages.

8. **New Entrant Status:** Nubicom/Remsa market entry mentioned but status unclear ("could be at risk" suggests uncertainty).

**Data Reliability:**
- Information appears consistent across multiple sources
- Technical specifications align with standard telecommunications practices
- Parent company relationship verifiable through multiple references
