## Executive Summary

Entel Chile is Chile's largest telecommunications operator with approximately 35% mobile market share and over 9 million mobile subscribers. The company has established clear network leadership, winning 9 major Opensignal awards in 2024 including all 5G experience categories. Entel leads in fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) with 45.5% market share and has pioneered a partnership with Starlink for satellite-to-cell services launching August 2025—one of only seven operators globally with such an agreement.
