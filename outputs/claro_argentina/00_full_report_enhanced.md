## Executive Summary

Claro Argentina is the market leader in Argentina's mobile telecommunications sector with approximately 39% market share and 25.3 million subscribers. As a subsidiary of Carlos Slim's América Móvil, Claro benefits from significant financial backing and regional expertise. The company invested $350 million for 100 MHz of 5G spectrum in 2023 and has deployed 400+ 5G radio nodes with plans for 60% population coverage by 2028. However, the competitive landscape is shifting dramatically with Telecom Argentina's acquisition of Movistar, which could create a dominant combined entity. Claro faces unique challenges operating in Argentina's hyperinflationary environment with peso-denominated revenues but USD-denominated network investments.

### Key Investment Highlights
- **Market Leadership:** 39% mobile market share, largest subscriber base
- **5G Investment:** $350M spectrum + US$200M network investment
- **Parent Backing:** América Móvil's US$67B market cap provides stability
- **Network Expansion:** 400+ 5G nodes, targeting 60% population by 2028
- **Competitive Threat:** Telecom-Movistar merger creates duopoly risk
- **Economic Headwinds:** Hyperinflation impacts ARPU in USD terms
