I apologize, but I noticed that while you provided a company profile context, you did not actually include the research sources that you mentioned would be analyzed. Without specific research sources, I cannot create a comprehensive research report with verified information.

To proceed, I would need:
- Academic/industry research papers
- Financial reports
- Annual reports
- Credible news articles
- Market research documents about SITA

If you can provide those sources, I can help you draft a detailed research report following the outlined structure and requirements.

In the meantime, I can offer some general guidance:
- For a technology company like SITA, key research sources would include:
  - SITA's official annual reports
  - Aviation industry analyst reports
  - Technology sector market research
  - Financial databases like Bloomberg or Reuters
  - Technology and aviation trade publications

Would you like to upload or share the specific research sources you intended to use for this analysis?
