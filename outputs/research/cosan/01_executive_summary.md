## Executive Summary

Cosan S.A. (ticker: CSAN3 on B3 and CSAN on NYSE) is a diversified conglomerate with significant interests in energy, logistics, infrastructure, and agriculture. Despite facing a challenging fiscal year in 2024, with a notable decrease in revenue and net earnings, Cosan's diversified asset portfolio and strategic growth initiatives position it for potential recovery and long-term growth. This report evaluates Cosan's financial health, market position, strategic direction, and investment potential, concluding with an investment rating.

### Company Overview

Cosan operates through a solid and diversified portfolio, including major subsidiaries like Raízen (in partnership with Shell), Rumo, Compass, and Moove. Founded in 1936, the company has expanded its operations across various sectors, leveraging Brazil's vast natural resources and growing energy market. Cosan's corporate structure and strategic investments aim to capitalize on Brazil's economic growth while navigating the complexities of its regulatory environment.

### Financial Analysis

The financial year 2024 was challenging for Cosan, with its revenue decreasing by 12.25% year over year to $7.11 billion and net earnings turning negative at BRL900 million. The EBITDA under management was approximately BRL30 billion, excluding non-recurring items. However, the company's revenue in the Brazilian market showed an 11.36% growth, indicating a strong domestic performance amidst global challenges. The discrepancy in revenue reports across different sources suggests a need for careful examination of consolidated versus segmented revenue streams.

### Market Position & Competition

Cosan's diversified operations grant it a unique position in the Brazilian market, with significant competition in each of its business units. In the energy sector, Raízen competes with other large fuel distributors and bioenergy companies. Rumo, Cosan's logistics arm, faces competition from other rail and port operators. Despite these challenges, Cosan's strong partnerships and strategic asset base provide a competitive edge.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

Cosan's strategy focuses on leveraging Brazil's economic growth, diversifying its energy portfolio, and expanding its logistics operations. The company's recent efforts to offload R$15bn in assets indicate a strategic realignment to focus on core, high-growth areas. Additionally, the planned capital hike of up to $1.9 billion is aimed at relieving debt and funding growth initiatives, suggesting a positive outlook for future expansion and profitability.

### Investment Thesis

Cosan presents a mixed investment opportunity. The company's diversified business model and strategic growth initiatives position it well for long-term success. However, the recent financial downturn and challenges in the global and domestic markets introduce risks that potential investors must consider. The company's ability to navigate these challenges and execute its strategic plan will be critical for future performance.

### Risks & Concerns

1. **Economic Volatility**: Brazil's economic instability and fluctuating commodity prices can significantly impact Cosan's operations.
2. **Regulatory Risks**: Changes in environmental and energy regulations could affect Cosan's cost structure and profitability.
3. **Debt Levels**: Despite efforts to alleviate debt, Cosan's financial leverage remains a concern, potentially impacting its growth and investment capabilities.

### Conclusion with Rating

Given Cosan's diversified business model, strategic growth initiatives, and the challenges it faces, a "Hold" rating is recommended for investors. The company's potential for long-term growth is balanced by short-term financial challenges and market volatility. Investors should closely monitor Cosan's execution of its strategic plan and the broader economic environment in Brazil.
