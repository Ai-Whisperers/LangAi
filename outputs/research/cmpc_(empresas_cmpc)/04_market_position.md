## Market Position & Competition

CMPC holds a significant market position, especially in the pulp and forest division, which generated about 61% of its 2024 EBITDA. However, the industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with companies like Suzano and UPM posing strong competition. CMPC's market capitalization as of December 2025 stood at USD 3.80 billion, reflecting its substantial but challenging position in the global market.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

CMPC's strategy focuses on sustainability, innovation, and expansion into new markets. The company's 2030 strategy outlines ambitious goals to consolidate its position as a leader in sustainable and renewable products. Investments in capacity expansion and the development of products to replace plastics and emission-intensive materials are key growth drivers.

### Investment Thesis

CMPC presents a mixed investment opportunity. The company's strong market position, commitment to sustainability, and strategic growth initiatives are positive indicators. However, the cyclical nature of the industry, increased leverage, and competitive pressures pose risks. Investors with a long-term horizon and tolerance for cyclical risk may find CMPC an attractive option.

### Risks & Concerns

1. **Cyclical Industry Risks:** The pulp and paper industry is highly cyclical, with prices and demand subject to global economic conditions.
2. **Increased Leverage:** CMPC's increased leverage in 2024 could constrain its financial flexibility.
3. **Competitive Pressures:** Intense competition from global players could impact market share and profitability.
4. **Environmental Regulations:** Stricter environmental regulations could increase operational costs.

### Conclusion with Rating

Given CMPC's solid market position, sustainability focus, and strategic growth plans, balanced against the cyclical nature of the industry and increased leverage, a "Hold" rating is recommended. Investors should monitor the company's debt levels and the global economic outlook closely, as these factors will significantly influence CMPC's performance.
