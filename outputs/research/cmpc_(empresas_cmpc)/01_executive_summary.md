## Executive Summary

Empresas CMPC, a leading player in the pulp and wood products industry, has shown resilience in the face of global economic challenges. Despite a slight decline in revenue and profit in 2024, the company's strategic positioning and commitment to sustainability position it for potential growth. However, investors should be cautious of the cyclical nature of the industry and the company's increased leverage.

### Company Overview

Empresas CMPC, headquartered in Santiago, Chile, operates in the production and sale of pulp, paper, tissue, and other related products. With a history of over a century, CMPC has expanded its footprint across the Americas, becoming a key player in the forestry and paper products industry. The company's commitment to sustainability is evident in its operations and product development.

### Financial Analysis

In 2024, CMPC reported a consolidated revenue of USD 7.74 billion, a 4.41% decrease from the previous year's USD 8.10 billion. The profit for the year stood at USD 491.05 million. The decline in revenue and profit can be attributed to lower global revenue growth and the cyclical nature of the pulp market. Despite this, the company maintained a solid EBITDA, although it experienced a 27% decrease quarter-over-quarter in Q4 2024. The company's net leverage in 2024 was 3.3x, with net debt of USD 4.9 billion, indicating increased leverage.

### Market Position & Competition

CMPC holds a significant market position, especially in the pulp and forest division, which generated about 61% of its 2024 EBITDA. However, the industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with companies like Suzano and UPM posing strong competition. CMPC's market capitalization as of December 2025 stood at USD 3.80 billion, reflecting its substantial but challenging position in the global market.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

CMPC's strategy focuses on sustainability, innovation, and expansion into new markets. The company's 2030 strategy outlines ambitious goals to consolidate its position as a leader in sustainable and renewable products. Investments in capacity expansion and the development of products to replace plastics and emission-intensive materials are key growth drivers.

### Investment Thesis

CMPC presents a mixed investment opportunity. The company's strong market position, commitment to sustainability, and strategic growth initiatives are positive indicators. However, the cyclical nature of the industry, increased leverage, and competitive pressures pose risks. Investors with a long-term horizon and tolerance for cyclical risk may find CMPC an attractive option.

### Risks & Concerns

1. **Cyclical Industry Risks:** The pulp and paper industry is highly cyclical, with prices and demand subject to global economic conditions.
2. **Increased Leverage:** CMPC's increased leverage in 2024 could constrain its financial flexibility.
3. **Competitive Pressures:** Intense competition from global players could impact market share and profitability.
4. **Environmental Regulations:** Stricter environmental regulations could increase operational costs.

### Conclusion with Rating

Given CMPC's solid market position, sustainability focus, and strategic growth plans, balanced against the cyclical nature of the industry and increased leverage, a "Hold" rating is recommended. Investors should monitor the company's debt levels and the global economic outlook closely, as these factors will significantly influence CMPC's performance.
