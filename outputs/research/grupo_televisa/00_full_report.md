Given the hypothetical nature of the sources and the future dates mentioned, the following investment analysis report on Grupo Televisa is based on the provided information and should be considered a fictional exercise.

### 1. Executive Summary

Grupo Televisa, a leading media company in the Spanish-speaking world, has shown a decline in revenue by 6% in 2024, with consolidated revenues dropping to MXN 62.26 billion from MXN 66.22 billion in 2023. Despite this, the company has managed to maintain a strong operating segment income margin and has implemented strategies aimed at recovering its adjusted EBITDA margins and returning to positive free cash flow (FCF) generation. The market capitalization has seen a significant increase, indicating investor confidence in its long-term growth prospects. This report evaluates Grupo Televisa's financial health, market position, strategic initiatives, and growth outlook to provide an investment recommendation.

### 2. Company Overview

Grupo Televisa is a multimedia conglomerate with a diverse portfolio that includes television production and broadcasting, satellite television services, cable TV, internet services, and publishing. It is the largest shareholder of TelevisaUnivision, a key player in producing and distributing Spanish-speaking content globally.

### 3. Financial Analysis

In 2024, Grupo Televisa reported a decrease in revenue by 6% year-over-year, with operating segment income also declining by 7.5%. Despite these challenges, the company has shown resilience by maintaining a solid segment margin of 36.9% and implementing cost-control measures to improve profitability. The market capitalization growth to $1.45 billion as of December 5, 2025, suggests a positive investor outlook.

### 4. Market Position & Competition

Grupo Televisa holds a dominant position in the Spanish-speaking media market, with significant reach in both the U.S. and Mexico. It faces competition from other media and telecommunications companies but differentiates itself through its extensive content library and multi-platform presence. The merger with Univision further strengthens its market position, expanding its audience base and content distribution capabilities.

### 5. Strategy & Growth Outlook

The company's growth strategy includes corporate restructuring to improve profitability, capex optimization, and increasing FCF generation. Grupo Televisa is also focusing on expanding its digital content offerings and integrating its telecommunications assets to leverage the growing demand for online content and connectivity services. These initiatives are expected to drive long-term growth and market expansion.

### 6. Investment Thesis

Grupo Televisa presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its strong market position, strategic growth initiatives, and the potential for margin improvement and FCF generation. While short-term challenges exist, the company's long-term prospects appear robust, supported by its strategic merger with Univision and focus on digital transformation.

### 7. Risks & Concerns

Key risks include the potential for further revenue declines due to competitive pressures and changing consumer preferences. The company's ability to execute its restructuring and growth strategies effectively is also critical. Additionally, macroeconomic factors and regulatory changes in the media and telecommunications sectors could impact performance.

### 8. Conclusion with Rating

Considering Grupo Televisa's solid market position, strategic initiatives aimed at growth and efficiency, and the positive investor sentiment as reflected in its market capitalization increase, we assign a "Buy" rating. Investors should monitor the company's progress in executing its growth strategies and managing operational risks. The potential for long-term value creation, combined with the company's resilience and strategic positioning, makes Grupo Televisa an attractive investment option.
