## 1. Executive Summary

Nike, Inc. (NYSE: NKE) faced revenue challenges in fiscal 2024, with annual revenue declining to approximately $51.36 billion from $51.54 billion in 2023, representing less than 1% growth year-over-year. The company's direct-to-consumer (DTC) strategy, which previously drove growth with DTC sales accounting for 42.3% of overall revenue, has shown signs of plateauing with digital sales declining 3% in recent quarters. Nike maintains its position as the world's largest sportswear manufacturer but is experiencing market share pressure from competitors like Adidas, New Balance, and emerging brands like On Running and Hoka. The company is now pivoting away from its pure DTC focus, bringing wholesalers back into its strategy while implementing cost-cutting measures of up to $2 billion.
