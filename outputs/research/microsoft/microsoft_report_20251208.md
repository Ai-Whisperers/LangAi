I apologize, but it seems that no research sources were actually provided in your request. Without specific sources to analyze, I cannot create a comprehensive research report about Microsoft.

To help you create such a report, I would recommend gathering research sources from:
- Microsoft's Annual Reports
- Financial databases like Bloomberg or Reuters
- Industry analysis reports
- Reputable technology and business publications
- Company press releases
- Analyst reports

If you'd like me to help you draft the report, please provide the specific research sources you want me to analyze. I can then:
- Review the sources
- Extract key information
- Organize the data into the requested report sections
- Provide citations
- Highlight any data limitations

Would you like to upload or share the research sources you'd like me to analyze?
