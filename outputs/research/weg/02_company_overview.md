### Market Position & Competition

WEG stands as a prominent player in the global market for electric motors and industrial electrical equipment. Its extensive product range and international presence have solidified its market position.

The company's commitment to innovation and sustainability serves as a competitive edge.

WEG's strategy focuses on expanding its global footprint, investing in research and development, and enhancing its sustainability practices. The acquisition of the industrial electric motors and generators business of Regal Rexnord underscores its growth ambitions and commitment to expanding its product portfolio.
