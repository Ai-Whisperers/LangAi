### 1. Executive Summary

FEMSA has demonstrated robust financial performance in 2024, with significant growth in total consolidated revenues and income from operations. Despite a reported decline in annual revenue compared to 2023, the company has shown resilience and strategic prowess in expanding its market presence, particularly through its OXXO stores and Coca-Cola FEMSA operations. This report evaluates FEMSA's financial health, market position, strategic initiatives, and growth outlook to provide an investment thesis.

### 2. Company Overview

FEMSA is a leading global player in the beverage, retail, and logistics & distribution industries. Founded in 1890, it has grown into a diversified conglomerate with significant operations in various sectors, including its flagship OXXO convenience store chain, Coca-Cola FEMSA, and a broad portfolio of other retail and strategic business units across Latin America and beyond.

### 3. Financial Analysis

In 2024, FEMSA reported a 12.8% growth in total consolidated revenues and a 31.5% increase in income from operations compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, showcasing strong operational efficiency and profitability. However, a source indicates a 9.87% decline in annual revenue for 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting some challenges in sustaining revenue growth year-over-year. Despite this, the company's strategic and operational advancements have contributed to a positive growth trajectory in key business segments.

### 4. Market Position & Competition

FEMSA holds a dominant position in the Latin American retail and beverage markets, with its OXXO stores and Coca-Cola FEMSA operations driving significant competitive advantages. The company's expansive retail network and strategic partnerships have solidified its market leadership. However, FEMSA faces competition from global and regional players in the retail and beverage sectors, necessitating continuous innovation and market expansion strategies to maintain its competitive edge.

### 5. Strategy & Growth Outlook

FEMSA's growth strategy focuses on expanding its retail footprint, enhancing operational efficiency, and pursuing strategic acquisitions to diversify its business portfolio. The company's investment in expanding OXXO stores and adapting to local consumer needs in Brazil exemplifies its commitment to growth and market penetration. Additionally, FEMSA's focus on sustainability and digital transformation initiatives positions it well for future growth opportunities.

### 6. Investment Thesis

FEMSA presents a compelling investment opportunity based on its strong market position, diversified business model, and strategic growth initiatives. The company's robust financial performance in 2024, despite some revenue challenges, underscores its operational resilience and potential for sustained growth. Investors should consider FEMSA's strategic investments, market expansion efforts, and focus on innovation as key drivers of long-term value creation.

### 7. Risks & Concerns

Key risks include economic volatility in Latin America, regulatory challenges, and competitive pressures that could impact FEMSA's operational and financial performance. Additionally, the company's ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and manage its diversified business portfolio remains critical in sustaining growth and profitability.

### 8. Conclusion with Rating

Based on FEMSA's strong financial performance, strategic growth initiatives, and market leadership position, we assign a "Buy" rating for long-term investors. The company's diversified operations, commitment to innovation, and strategic market expansion efforts provide a solid foundation for future growth and shareholder value creation.
