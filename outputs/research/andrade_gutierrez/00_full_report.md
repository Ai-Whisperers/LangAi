### Executive Summary

Andrade Gutierrez Engenharia (AGE) is a leading engineering and construction firm with a significant presence in Brazil and operations spanning Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Despite facing financial challenges, including credit rating downgrades by Fitch, the company has shown signs of stabilization and growth potential. This report evaluates AGE's financial health, market position, strategic initiatives, and growth outlook to provide an investment analysis.

### Company Overview

Founded in 1948 and headquartered in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, Andrade Gutierrez S.A. has expanded its operations globally, engaging in engineering and construction projects, telecommunications, and concessions sectors. The company has a diverse portfolio, including infrastructure projects and investments in various sectors, contributing to its resilience and adaptability in changing market conditions.

### Financial Analysis

AGE closed March 2024 with a backlog of approximately BRL 13 billion, showing an improvement from 2023's BRL 11 billion mark. This growth indicates a strong project pipeline and potential revenue generation. However, Fitch downgraded AGE's ratings to 'CC' and later to 'C', reflecting concerns over its financial stability and debt management. The company's revenue stood at approximately R$3.5 billion in 2024, with expectations to double, supported by renegotiations of debt with foreign bondholders and a focus on revenue-generating projects.

### Market Position & Competition

AGE operates in a highly competitive sector, facing challenges from both domestic and international engineering and construction firms. Despite this, its extensive experience, diverse portfolio, and strategic partnerships, such as with ALICE Technologies and Sener for optimizing construction efficiency, strengthen its market position. The company's ability to secure significant investments and contracts, including a notable increase in Chinese investments in Brazil, further solidifies its standing.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

AGE's strategy focuses on stabilizing its financial position through debt renegotiation and leveraging its backlog to secure future revenues. The company aims to enhance operational efficiency and competitiveness by adopting AI-driven project scheduling and targeting sectors with high growth potential, such as mining. With a backlog of BRL 17 billion for 2024 and 2025 and new contracts worth about BRL 4 billion signed in 2023, AGE is positioned for growth, assuming successful debt management and project execution.

### Investment Thesis

AGE presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The company's substantial backlog and strategic initiatives indicate potential for growth and recovery. However, its financial challenges and credit rating downgrades highlight significant risks. Investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon may find AGE an attractive option, given its efforts to stabilize and grow its operations.

### Risks & Concerns

Key risks include AGE's ability to manage and refinance its debt, the impact of credit rating downgrades on investor confidence and financing costs, and execution risks associated with its project backlog. Additionally, the competitive landscape and potential regulatory changes in its operating markets could affect its performance.

### Conclusion with Rating

Considering AGE's current financial challenges, market position, growth strategy, and associated risks, a cautious investment approach is recommended. Investors should closely monitor the company's debt management efforts, project execution, and market developments. Given the potential for recovery and growth against significant risks, a "Hold" rating is advised, with a recommendation to reassess as the company progresses with its strategic initiatives and financial stabilization efforts.

**Note:** This analysis is based on publicly available information and projections. Investors should conduct their due diligence and consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before making investment decisions.
