## Company Overview

Embraer is a global aerospace company headquartered in Brazil, known for its commercial, military, executive, and agricultural aircraft. The company also provides a range of services and support to its customers worldwide. Embraer's diverse portfolio and commitment to innovation have established it as a key player in the aerospace industry.

### Financial Analysis

In 2024, Embraer reported a record revenue of USD 6.4 billion, a 21% increase from the previous year, with a delivery of 206 aircraft. This performance was at the high end of the company's guidance, indicating strong operational efficiency and market demand. However, the company posted a US$4.7 million loss in 2Q25, which raises concerns about its short-term profitability. Despite this, the company's market capitalization has grown, reaching $12.33 billion as of December 2025, reflecting investor confidence in its long-term prospects.

### Market Position & Competition

Embraer holds a significant position in the sub-150-seat aircraft market, with a forecasted demand for 10,500 aircraft through 2044. The company's strategic focus on this segment allows it to leverage its expertise and innovation to meet specific market needs, differentiating itself from competitors like Boeing and Airbus. However, the competitive landscape remains challenging, requiring continuous innovation and market adaptation.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

Embraer's growth strategy includes expanding its product portfolio, entering new markets, and making strategic investments in technology and infrastructure. The company plans to invest $500 million in the U.S., potentially creating 2,500 jobs, and has announced partnerships and investments aimed at enhancing its product offerings and market reach. Embraer's strong backlog, which reached an all-time high of $29.7 billion in 2Q25, provides visibility into future revenue and growth prospects.

### Investment Thesis

Embraer's record revenue in 2024, strategic market positioning, and robust backlog support a positive investment outlook. The company's focus on the sub-150-seat aircraft market, coupled with strategic investments and partnerships, positions it well for future growth. While short-term profitability concerns exist, Embraer's long-term growth prospects and market position make it an attractive investment opportunity.

### Risks & Concerns

Key risks include economic downturns affecting aircraft demand, competition from major aerospace manufacturers, regulatory challenges, and potential impacts of U.S. tariffs on profitability. Additionally, the company's ability to maintain its growth momentum and manage operational costs will be critical in sustaining its financial performance.

### Conclusion with Rating

Considering Embraer's strong financial performance in 2024, strategic growth initiatives, and solid market position, we assign a "Buy" rating. Investors should closely monitor the company's profitability and the impact of external risks on its operations. However, Embraer's long-term growth prospects and strategic positioning in the aerospace industry present a compelling investment opportunity.
