## 4. Market Position & Competition

Grupo Matte holds a commanding position in several sectors. Empresas CMPC is a leading player in the forestry and paper products industry, with a significant portion of its revenue generated from exports. The recent strategic moves in the banking sector through the acquisition of Grupo Security highlight Grupo Matte's ambition to strengthen its position in financial services. However, competition from other conglomerates and international players remains a challenge.

#### 5. Strategy & Growth Outlook

Grupo Matte's strategy focuses on diversification and strategic acquisitions to bolster its market position. The acquisition of Grupo Security is a testament to its growth-oriented strategy, aiming to create a significant presence in the banking sector. The group's investment in green loans and sustainable practices ("BBVA Top Deals – 2024") also indicates a forward-looking approach, aligning with global trends towards sustainability.

#### 6. Investment Thesis

Grupo Matte represents a robust investment opportunity due to its diversified portfolio, strategic growth initiatives, and strong market position. The group's focus on expanding its banking operations and commitment to sustainability are likely to drive long-term growth. Investors seeking exposure to Chile's diverse industrial and financial sectors may find Grupo Matte an attractive option.

#### 7. Risks & Concerns

Key risks include exposure to Chile's economic fluctuations and regulatory changes, especially in the banking and forestry sectors. The group's significant reliance on exports also exposes it to global market volatility and currency risks. Additionally, the success of the Grupo Security acquisition and integration poses execution risk.

#### 8. Conclusion with Rating

Considering Grupo Matte's diversified business model, strategic growth initiatives, and solid financial position, we assign a "Strong Buy" rating for long-term investors. The group's proactive management and expansion into the banking sector are likely to yield positive returns. However, investors should monitor potential risks associated with economic downturns, regulatory changes, and global market volatility.
