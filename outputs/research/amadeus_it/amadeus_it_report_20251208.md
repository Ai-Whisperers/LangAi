I apologize, but I noticed that while you provided a company profile context, you did not actually include the research sources that you mentioned would be analyzed. Without the specific research sources, I cannot create a comprehensive research report.

To proceed, I would need:
- Academic/industry research papers
- Financial reports
- Annual reports
- Credible news articles
- Market research documents about Amadeus IT

If you can provide those sources, I'll be happy to help you draft a detailed research report following the outlined structure and requirements.

Would you like to:
1. Upload the research sources now
2. Provide links to the sources
3. Have me demonstrate the report format using publicly available information about Amadeus IT
4. Take a different approach to the research report

What would you prefer?
