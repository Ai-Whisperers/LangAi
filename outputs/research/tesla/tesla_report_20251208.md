# Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) - Comprehensive Research Report

## 1. Executive Summary

Tesla, Inc. maintains its position as a leading electric vehicle manufacturer with a market capitalization of $1.51 trillion and annual revenue of $97.69 billion in 2024, representing a modest 0.95% increase from 2023. Despite strong financial metrics, the company faces increasing competitive pressure, with its U.S. EV market share declining from 75% in early 2022 to 43.5% in Q1 2025. Tesla's high valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 311.64, reflect investor confidence in future growth potential, though recent quarterly performance shows challenges with revenue declining 1.56% and EPS dropping 64.02% in Q3 2025.
