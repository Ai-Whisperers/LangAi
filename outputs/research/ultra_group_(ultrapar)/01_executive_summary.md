## Executive Summary

Ultrapar Participações S.A. (UGP), a leading Brazilian conglomerate operating in the energy, mobility, and infrastructure sectors, has shown a mixed financial performance in recent years. Despite a decrease in Recurring EBITDA in Q4 2024 and a slight decline in overall 2024 EBITDA, the company reported a net income increase and a significant revenue growth in 2024. This analysis aims to evaluate Ultrapar's investment potential by examining its financial health, market position, competitive landscape, strategic initiatives, and growth outlook.

### Company Overview

Ultrapar Participações S.A., founded in 1937, is a diversified holding company with significant interests in fuel distribution (Ipiranga), LPG distribution (Ultragaz), liquid bulk storage (Ultracargo), and other energy and infrastructure-related businesses. The company has a strong presence in Brazil and is known for its strategic investments in key sectors of the economy.

### Financial Analysis

In 2024, Ultrapar reported a net income of R$2.526 billion and net revenues of R$133.50 billion, marking a 5.91% increase from the previous year. However, the company experienced a 23% decrease in Recurring EBITDA in Q4 2024 and a 4% decrease in overall EBITDA for the year. Despite these challenges, the company's revenue growth and net income improvement indicate resilience and potential for recovery.

### Market Position & Competition

Ultrapar operates in highly competitive sectors, including energy and logistics. The company's financial performance and market position are influenced by global energy prices, regulatory changes, and competition from both domestic and international players. Despite these challenges, Ultrapar's diversified business model and significant market share in Brazil provide a competitive edge.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

Ultrapar's strategic focus on optimizing its business portfolio, investing in high-margin operations, and regional expansion has been evident in its recent initiatives. The company's efforts to strengthen its logistics operations and expand its storage capacity align with its long-term growth strategy. These strategic moves are expected to enhance Ultrapar's market position and drive future growth.

### Investment Thesis

Ultrapar presents a compelling investment opportunity for those looking for exposure to Brazil's energy and infrastructure sectors. The company's diversified business model, strategic growth initiatives, and strong market position offer potential for long-term value creation. However, investors should consider the risks associated with the cyclical nature of Ultrapar's business segments and the volatile Brazilian economic environment.

### Risks & Concerns

Key risks include fluctuations in global energy prices, regulatory changes in Brazil, and intense competition. Additionally, the company's financial performance could be impacted by macroeconomic factors, including currency volatility and economic downturns in Brazil. Investors should also monitor the company's debt levels and its ability to maintain profitability across its business segments.

### Conclusion with Rating

Considering Ultrapar's solid market position, strategic growth initiatives, and recent financial performance, we assign a "Hold" rating with a positive outlook. While the company faces challenges, including decreased EBITDA and competitive pressures, its revenue growth, net income improvement, and strategic investments position it for potential future success. Investors should closely monitor Ultrapar's execution of its growth strategy and any changes in the macroeconomic and regulatory environment.

This analysis is based on information available up to 2023 and should be considered as one input in a comprehensive investment decision-making process.
