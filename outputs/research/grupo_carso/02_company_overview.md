## Company Overview

Grupo Carso, founded in 1980 and headquartered in Mexico City, operates in various sectors, including retail, industrial, infrastructure, construction, and energy. The conglomerate's significant subsidiaries include Grupo Sanborns and Grupo Condumex, among others. Grupo Carso is known for its strategic diversification and presence in key economic sectors in Latin America.

### Financial Analysis

Grupo Carso's financial performance in 2024 indicates a revenue increase to 202.98 billion, up 2.28% from the previous year, with a net income of 16.73 billion Mexican pesos. The company's EBITDA margin is expected to gain, reflecting some operational efficiency improvements. However, the nearly flat net profit growth (+1.5% YoY) suggests challenges in translating revenue growth into bottom-line results. The company's market capitalization has shown fluctuations, reflecting investor sentiment and market conditions.

### Market Position & Competition

Grupo Carso holds a strong market position within its operational sectors, benefiting from a diversified business model. However, it faces competition from both domestic and international players across its various segments. Notably, in the industrial and retail sectors, competitors like Hitachi Ltd. pose challenges in market share and technological advancements.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

Grupo Carso's strategy focuses on leveraging its diversified business model to mitigate sector-specific risks and capitalize on growth opportunities. The company's investments in retail expansion, particularly in specialized formats like Dax, and its exploration of opportunities in energy and infrastructure, signal a commitment to strategic growth. The feasibility review of the Lakach deepwater gas field project underscores Grupo Carso's ambition in the energy sector.

### Investment Thesis

Grupo Carso offers a balanced investment opportunity, with its diversified operations providing a hedge against sector-specific downturns. The company's strategic investments and solid market positioning in key sectors suggest potential for long-term growth. However, the modest net profit growth and the need for operational efficiencies temper the investment outlook.

### Risks & Concerns

Investors should consider several risks, including economic volatility in Latin America, regulatory changes, and competition. The company's broad sectoral exposure, while a strength, also poses challenges in maintaining operational efficiency and market leadership across diverse industries. Additionally, global economic uncertainties could impact Grupo Carso's financial performance.

### Conclusion with Rating

Considering Grupo Carso's steady revenue growth, strategic positioning, and long-term growth prospects, balanced against its financial performance and external risks, a "Hold" rating is recommended. Investors should monitor the company's progress in operational efficiencies, market expansion efforts, and the impact of economic conditions on its diverse business segments.
