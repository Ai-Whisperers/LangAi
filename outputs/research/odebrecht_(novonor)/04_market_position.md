## 4. Market Position & Competition

Novonor's market position is strengthened by its diversified portfolio and presence in multiple countries. The company's engineering and construction arm, OEC, has 31 active projects, indicating a robust project pipeline (Odebrecht.com). However, the competitive landscape in the construction and petrochemical sectors is intense, with numerous global players vying for market share. Novonor's ability to secure new projects and optimize its asset portfolio, including the potential sale of its Braskem stake, will be crucial for its market positioning.

#### 5. Strategy & Growth Outlook

Novonor's strategy focuses on operational efficiency, portfolio optimization, and leveraging its core competencies in engineering and construction. The company's growth outlook is cautiously optimistic, with a project portfolio that could exceed US$5 billion (Odebrecht.com). The potential sale of its controlling stake in Braskem to Abu Dhabi's Adnoc for R10.5bn highlights its strategic asset realignment (Argus Media). Additionally, the company's efforts to reduce debt and improve governance standards signal a positive growth trajectory.

#### 6. Investment Thesis

Investing in Novonor presents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. The company's extensive project pipeline, strategic divestitures, and restructuring efforts provide a foundation for recovery and growth. However, the investment thesis is tempered by the company's financial challenges, including high net debt and dependency on Braskem dividends. A successful turnaround will hinge on Novonor's ability to execute its strategy, improve financial health, and navigate the competitive landscape.

#### 7. Risks & Concerns

- **Financial Health**: High net debt and reliance on Braskem dividends pose significant risks.
- **Market Competition**: Intense competition in the construction and petrochemical sectors could impact growth.
- **Asset Sales**: The outcome of strategic asset sales, including the Braskem stake, is uncertain.
- **Reputation**: Past controversies may affect business opportunities and stakeholder trust.

#### 8. Conclusion with Rating

Given the analysis, Novonor is rated as a **"Hold"** with a cautious outlook. The company's strategic initiatives and project pipeline present potential for growth and recovery. However, financial vulnerabilities and market competition necessitate a prudent approach. Investors should closely monitor Novonor's financial performance, asset sale outcomes, and market position before increasing their stake.
