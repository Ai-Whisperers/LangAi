        "content": "In 2024, Microsoft Research continued its foundational research to expand the capabilities of large language models, but we also explored more deeply how smaller models (opens in new tab) can be trained for specific tasks. Microsoft Research and its external collaborators used AI to enable earlier detection and treatment of esophageal cancer, which could lead to dramatically improved survival rates, and to accelerate the discovery of new drugs needed to treat infectious diseases that kill millions of people every year. Leading researchers at Microsoft explored the latest breakthroughs in AI models, new applications of AI to important scientific challenges, novel approaches to model evaluation and understanding, and other key research topics. Leading researchers at Microsoft shared the latest multimodal AI models, advanced benchmarks for AI evaluation and model self-improvement, and an entirely new kind of computer for AI inference and hard optimization. Microsoft researchers are working to apply foundation models—large-scale models that take advantage of recent AI advances—to scientific disciplines.",
