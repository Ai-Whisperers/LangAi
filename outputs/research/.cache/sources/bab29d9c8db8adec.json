        "content": "The company, long referred to as “Ma Bell,” swelled to great corporate heights as it built much of the United States’ local and long-distance telephone services, controlling a monopoly in the telecommunications industry for nearly a century. In 1984, the U.S. government won a decades-long battle to dismantle the monopoly, splitting 22 regional operating companies into seven regional phone companies that were nicknamed Baby Bells. In March of 2011, AT&T launched a $39 billion takeover of **T-Mobile** (TMUS) that would have once again created a near-monopoly, this time to become the largest cellular carrier in the U.S. At the time, broadband capacity was an issue, and an AT&T and T-Mobile merger, the companies said, would lead to better service with fewer dropped calls and a wider network. AT&T’s decision to focus on wireless and fiber departs from the Bell Labs–type technological innovation of its 20th-century peak, but brings the company back to its roots of clear, connected, and reliable communication.",
