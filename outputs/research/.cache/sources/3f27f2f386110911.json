        "content": "* Competition from within the financial industry is probably the strongest of Porter's Five Forces when analyzing JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is a major global bank holding and financial services company. An analysis of JPMorgan Chase using Porter's Five Forces reveals that the company must concentrate on the competition from industry rivals, the bargaining power of consumers, and the threat of substitute products. Competition within the financial industry is probably the strongest of Porter's model when analyzing JPMorgan Chase. The threat of substitute products has increased in the banking industry, as companies outside the industry have begun to offer specialized financial services that were traditionally only available from banks. JPMorgan's approach to dealing with this force is to try to attract new clients and to increase the extent to which existing depositors hold funds and access the bank's services. While brand new entrants may not be much of a threat, JPMorgan does have to brace for some competition from already established banks in other countries.",
