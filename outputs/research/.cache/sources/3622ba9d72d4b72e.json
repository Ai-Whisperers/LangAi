        "content": "The competitive landscape up until now has stayed remarkably predictable: AT&T led in perception for large enterprises [1,000+ employees], Verizon the midsized market [20-999 employees], T-Mobile leveraged its consumer momentum to establish a beachhead in small business [<20 employees] and Comcast and Spectrum fighting for a seat at the table. Verizon is seen as having the most reliable network coverage overall, and this perception has positioned them to take market share from both AT&T and T-Mobile in the large business segment. T-Mobile has a commanding position as the perceived leader in the small business market, with the highest \"complete experience\" and \"ease of use\" scores. However, as T-Mobile tries to gain market share with midsize and large business segments, the consumer-focused \"un-carrier\" approach starts to fall apart, and a strategic shift is needed. Improving customer perception for mobile services through driving a better customer experience will help Comcast expand beyond the small business market.",
