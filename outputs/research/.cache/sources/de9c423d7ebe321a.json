        "content": "JPMorgan Chase & Co. is an American multinational banking and financial services company formed through the December 2000 merger of J.P. Morgan & Co. and The Chase Manhattan Corporation. JPMorgan Chase traces its roots to some of the oldest financial institutions in the U.S. These include The Bank of the Manhattan Company, founded in 1799 under the leadership of politician Aaron Burr, and Drexel Morgan & Co., a merchant bank established in 1871 that specialized in railroad investment. JPMorgan Chase has an expansive suite of services and operations—from consumer, corporate, and investment banking to financial technology—categorized into four core business areas. In 1988, the bank was renamed J.P. Morgan and Co. By the end of the 20th century, it had become a leading U.S. underwriter of corporate debt and one of the world’s most respected investment banking houses. In 2000, J.P. Morgan and Co. merged with Chase Manhattan to create JPMorgan Chase & Co. The new firm combined Chase Manhattan’s experience in personal and small-business banking with J.P. Morgan’s background in investment banking, government securities, and commercial banking.",
