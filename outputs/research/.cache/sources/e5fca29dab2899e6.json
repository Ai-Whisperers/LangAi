        "content": "# Coca-Cola lowers ambition with new 2035 packaging and sustainability targets. The beverage company introduced two new targets centered on packaging design and collection after use, but did not set a specific emissions reduction goal for 2035. * The Coca-Cola Co. announced Monday new packaging and other sustainability goals to reach by 2035. * One new goal calls for using 35% to 40% recycled material in primary packaging (plastic, glass and aluminum), including increasing recycled plastic use to between 30% and 35% globally.The other new goal focuses on partnering to collect used packaging; the company aims to help ensure the collection of 70% to 75% of the equivalent number of bottles and cans introduced into the market annually. Coca-Cola’s new goals not only push out the target year across its goal areas, they also appear to narrow the company’s ambition. * Coca-Cola ‘on track’ for packaging recyclability goal, ‘behind plan’ on recycled content target   By Maria Rachal •  Aug. 23, 2024.",
