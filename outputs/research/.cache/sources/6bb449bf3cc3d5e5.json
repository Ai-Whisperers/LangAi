        "content": "# Ford Is Secretly Offering Discounts on New Cars to Keep Frustrated Owners From Leaving. With record recalls this year, Ford is trying everything to keep customers around, including incentives towards new cars. One of those recall issues (rearview cameras) prompted Ford to offer a new warranty for cars as old as 15 years old, and it seems the bigwigs in Detroit are worried they might lose customers. One step they’re taking is redesigning dealerships to make car buying feel easier, and the latest, detailed in a bulletin sent to dealers the week before Thanksgiving, is a new Owner Retention Program offering owners with major service and repair issues a discount worth 10% off the MSRP of a new Ford, according to *CarsDirect*. Furthermore, the 10% discount is capped at $6,000 on Fords and $10,000 on Lincolns, and the program is inexplicably not offered in California, the nation’s largest car market.",
