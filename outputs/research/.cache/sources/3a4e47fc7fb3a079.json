        "content": "* Nike’s global market share (for sneakers and apparel) dropped to 16.4% in 2024 from 17.1% in 2022. With all those problems, Nike’s global market share (for sneakers and apparel) has dropped less than one percentage point, from 17.1% in 2022 to 16.4% in 2024, according to Euromonitor data. “I don’t think Nike gives up the No. 1 spot, but it wouldn’t surprise me if they have a smaller share in the U.S.,” Powell says. “They already have a smaller share than they had five years ago.” The distance between Nike and its competitors is still vast enough for now that it can stand to lose a percentage point of market share. “Nike isn’t going anywhere, but when you compare Nike to how it was from around 2000 to 2010, that was a really innovative period for the brand,” says Mike D. “But I think it’s important for Nike as a brand to rediscover its identity in athletic gear—its core identity.”.",
