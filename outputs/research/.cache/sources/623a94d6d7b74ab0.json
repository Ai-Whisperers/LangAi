        "content": "For the fourth quarter alone, Ford reported EBIT gains of more than a billion dollars to $2.1 billion compared with $1.1 billion a year ago. But Ford Model e, the division that develops electric vehicles, reported a full-year EBIT loss of $5.1 billion, as the company continues to invest in future products. That guidance does not include any regulatory uncertainty, but it does assume Ford will hit its target of $1 billion in cost cuts this year, House said. In early January, Ford said its U.S. new vehicle sales rose 4% to nearly 2.1 million vehicles last year compared with 2023, an increase driven by sales of trucks. Ford said its full-year net income was $5.9 billion compared with $4.3 billion in 2023. While Ford said its Model e unit sustained a 2024 full-year loss of $5 billion, the company is improving its overall production quality and is significantly reducing warranty costs, a long-term goal Farley has had since he took the helm in 2020.",
