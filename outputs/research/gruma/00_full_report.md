In 2024, the company achieved net sales of US$6.5 billion, with a notable 73% of sales coming from non-Mexican operations.

The company faces competition from local and international food producers but maintains a competitive edge through its scale, brand recognition, and diversified product offerings.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

Gruma's strategic investments in new production facilities, such as the MXN 792 million investment in a new snack production center in Puebla, underscore its commitment to growth and expansion.
