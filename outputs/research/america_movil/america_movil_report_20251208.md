I apologize, but I noticed that while you provided a company profile context, you did not actually include the research sources that you mentioned would be analyzed. Without specific research sources, I cannot create a comprehensive research report with verified information.

To proceed, I would need:
1. Actual research sources (academic papers, financial reports, news articles, etc.)
2. Specific data points about America Movil

However, I can provide a template of the research report based on the context you've shared, which could be filled in once sources are available:
