## Company Overview

Gerdau S.A. is a global leader in long steel production and one of the largest recyclers in the Americas. With a broad operational footprint, Gerdau has steel production facilities worldwide, focusing on serving the construction, industrial, and agricultural sectors. The company's commitment to sustainability and innovation is evident in its investments in eco-friendly technologies and new business divisions.

### Financial Analysis

Gerdau's financial performance has shown volatility, with annual revenue for 2024 reported at $12.427 billion, a 9.98% decline from 2023, and a further decrease from 2022. The net profit also declined significantly in 2024 to BRL 4.600 billion from BRL 6.854 billion in 2023. Despite these challenges, Gerdau maintains a solid market capitalization, with figures ranging from $4.52 billion to $7.33 billion in late 2025, indicating market confidence in its long-term value.

### Market Position & Competition

Gerdau holds a strong position in the steel industry, benefiting from its extensive geographic footprint and diversified product range. However, the steel industry is highly competitive, with key competitors including Nucor, ArcelorMittal, and US Steel. Gerdau's ability to maintain cost efficiency and innovate in product offerings is crucial to sustaining its competitive edge.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

Gerdau's strategic focus on operational efficiency and market expansion, particularly in the U.S., is timely. The company's investment in expanding its electric arc furnace (EAF) capacity in Texas and freezing projects in Brazil to focus on the U.S. market demonstrates a strategic pivot towards regions with higher growth potential. Additionally, Gerdau's emphasis on sustainability and recycling aligns with global trends towards environmentally responsible manufacturing.

### Investment Thesis

Gerdau presents a balanced investment opportunity, with potential risks mitigated by strategic growth initiatives and a strong market position. The company's focus on operational efficiency, capacity expansion in growth markets, and sustainability initiatives positions it well for long-term growth. Investors should weigh Gerdau's recent financial volatility against its strategic investments and market potential.

### Risks & Concerns

Key risks include global economic fluctuations affecting steel demand, intense competition, and potential operational disruptions. Additionally, Gerdau's significant investments in growth initiatives could strain short-term financial performance if not executed effectively.

### Conclusion with Rating

Considering Gerdau's strategic initiatives, market position, and the inherent risks, a "Hold" rating is recommended for investors seeking long-term growth with a moderate risk tolerance. While recent financial performance has shown challenges, Gerdau's strategic focus and market potential provide a solid foundation for future value creation. Investors should closely monitor the company's execution of its growth strategies and market developments.
