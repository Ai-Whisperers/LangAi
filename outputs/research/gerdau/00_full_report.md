### Executive Summary

Gerdau S.A. (NYSE: GGB), a leading steel producer, has shown a mixed financial performance over recent years, with notable revenue declines in 2024 but strategic investments aimed at operational efficiency and market expansion. Despite facing challenges such as decreased net profit and revenue, Gerdau's efforts in improving operational efficiency and expanding capacity, particularly in the U.S. market, highlight its resilience and potential for future growth. This report evaluates Gerdau's financial health, market position, strategic initiatives, and growth outlook to provide an investment thesis, considering the risks and opportunities ahead.

### Company Overview

Gerdau S.A. is a global leader in long steel production and one of the largest recyclers in the Americas. With a broad operational footprint, Gerdau has steel production facilities worldwide, focusing on serving the construction, industrial, and agricultural sectors. The company's commitment to sustainability and innovation is evident in its investments in eco-friendly technologies and new business divisions.

### Financial Analysis

Gerdau's financial performance has shown volatility, with annual revenue for 2024 reported at $12.427 billion, a 9.98% decline from 2023, and a further decrease from 2022. The net profit also declined significantly in 2024 to BRL 4.600 billion from BRL 6.854 billion in 2023. Despite these challenges, Gerdau maintains a solid market capitalization, with figures ranging from $4.52 billion to $7.33 billion in late 2025, indicating market confidence in its long-term value.

### Market Position & Competition

Gerdau holds a strong position in the steel industry, benefiting from its extensive geographic footprint and diversified product range.

Gerdau's ability to maintain cost efficiency and innovate in product offerings is crucial to sustaining its competitive edge.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

Gerdau's strategic focus on operational efficiency and market expansion, particularly in the U.S., is timely.

Additionally, Gerdau's emphasis on sustainability and recycling aligns with global trends towards environmentally responsible manufacturing.

### Investment Thesis

### Conclusion with Rating

Considering Gerdau's strategic initiatives, market position, and the inherent risks, a "Hold" rating is recommended for investors seeking long-term growth with a moderate risk tolerance. While recent financial performance has shown challenges, Gerdau's strategic focus and market potential provide a solid foundation for future value creation.
