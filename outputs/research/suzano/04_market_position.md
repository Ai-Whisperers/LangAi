The company's entry into the paperboard business in the US in 2024, generating $3 billion in revenues and significantly contributing to its EBITDA, exemplifies its strategic market expansion. However, Suzano operates in a highly competitive industry, facing challenges from other major players in the pulp and paper sector.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

Suzano's strategic initiatives, including the expansion of its pulp production capacity and diversification into the paperboard market, are pivotal to its growth outlook. The company's commitment to sustainability and the development of eco-friendly products align with global trends towards environmental responsibility, potentially opening new markets and opportunities for growth.

### Investment Thesis

The company's ability to leverage favorable market conditions and execute strategic growth initiatives positions it well for continued success.

### Risks & Concerns

Key risks include market volatility, particularly in commodity prices and exchange rates, which could impact profitability. Additionally, intense competition and regulatory changes in environmental policies pose potential challenges. The company's ability to manage these risks effectively is crucial for sustaining its growth momentum.

### Conclusion with Rating

The company's prospects for continued growth, coupled with its resilience in navigating market challenges, make it an attractive investment.
