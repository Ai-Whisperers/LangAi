## Company Overview

Suzano S.A. is a prominent player in the pulp and paper industry, with a diversified product portfolio that includes pulp, coated and uncoated printing and writing paper, paperboard, and tissue paper. The company has expanded its global footprint through strategic acquisitions and the development of new mills, such as the one in Mato Grosso do Sul state, which contributed to its record sales in 2024.

### Financial Analysis

In 2024, Suzano achieved a significant milestone with net revenues reaching R$47.4 billion, marking a 19% increase from the previous year. This growth was attributed to higher sales volumes and favorable exchange rates, enhancing its export revenues. The company's Adjusted EBITDA of R$6.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024 further underscores its strong financial performance. Additionally, Suzano's market capitalization as of November 2025 stands at $11.86 billion, reflecting investor confidence in its financial health and growth prospects.

### Market Position & Competition

Suzano holds a competitive position in the global pulp and paper market, benefiting from its large-scale operations and cost-efficient production capabilities. The company's entry into the paperboard business in the US in 2024, generating $3 billion in revenues and significantly contributing to its EBITDA, exemplifies its strategic market expansion. However, Suzano operates in a highly competitive industry, facing challenges from other major players in the pulp and paper sector.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

Suzano's strategic initiatives, including the expansion of its pulp production capacity and diversification into the paperboard market, are pivotal to its growth outlook. The company's commitment to sustainability and the development of eco-friendly products align with global trends towards environmental responsibility, potentially opening new markets and opportunities for growth.

### Investment Thesis

The company's ability to leverage favorable market conditions and execute strategic growth initiatives positions it well for continued success.

### Risks & Concerns

Additionally, intense competition and regulatory changes in environmental policies pose potential challenges. The company's ability to manage these risks effectively is crucial for sustaining its growth momentum.

### Conclusion with Rating

Considering Suzano's robust financial performance, strategic growth initiatives, and strong market position, we assign a "Buy" rating. The company's prospects for continued growth, coupled with its resilience in navigating market challenges, make it an attractive investment.
