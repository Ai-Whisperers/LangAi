### Executive Summary

Cencosud, a leading retail company in Latin America, has shown a robust performance in 2024, with a significant 15.9% increase in revenue, reaching CLP $16,493,815 million (USD 17,477 million). This growth is attributed to a comprehensive transformation strategy, expansion into new markets, and a focus on online sales. The company's strategic acquisitions, including a notable entry into the U.S. market, and expansion plans for 2025, position it well for future growth. However, investors should be mindful of the competitive retail landscape and macroeconomic risks. Based on the financial performance, market position, and growth outlook, we recommend a "Buy" rating for Cencosud.

### Company Overview

Cencosud S.A. is a diversified retail company operating in several Latin American countries, the United States, and China. It manages a variety of retail formats, including supermarkets, home improvement stores, department stores, and shopping centers. Founded in Chile, Cencosud has expanded its footprint significantly, becoming one of the largest retail companies in Latin America.

### Financial Analysis

In 2024, Cencosud reported a revenue of CLP 16.49 trillion, marking a 15.9% increase from the previous year. This growth was fueled by online sales and expansion across its operating regions. The company's EBITDA and net income also saw positive trends, indicating efficient operations and profitability. The financial health of Cencosud is further evidenced by its market capitalization growth to $8.76 billion USD as of December 2025, reflecting investor confidence.

### Market Position & Competition

Cencosud holds a strong market position in the retail sector, with a significant presence in Latin America and strategic expansions into the U.S. market. Its diverse portfolio allows it to cater to a wide range of consumer needs. However, the retail industry is highly competitive, with players like Walmart and Carrefour also expanding in these regions. Cencosud's ability to innovate and adapt to consumer trends, particularly in e-commerce, is crucial for maintaining its competitive edge.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

Cencosud's growth strategy focuses on digital transformation, market expansion, and enhancing customer experience. The acquisition of The Fresh Market in the U.S. and plans to open 24 new supermarkets in 2025 demonstrate its commitment to growth. Additionally, the company's investment in technology and online platforms is expected to drive future revenue growth and operational efficiency.

### Investment Thesis

Cencosud presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its strong financial performance, strategic market expansions, and focus on digital transformation. The company's diversified business model and presence in high-growth markets position it well for sustained growth. While competition and macroeconomic risks exist, Cencosud's strategic initiatives and robust financials support a positive outlook.

### Risks & Concerns

Investors should consider the competitive landscape, currency fluctuations, and economic conditions in Cencosud's operating regions. Additionally, the success of its U.S. market entry and ongoing digital transformation initiatives pose execution risks. However, the company's track record and strategic focus mitigate these concerns to an extent.

### Conclusion with Rating

Considering Cencosud's strong financial performance, strategic growth initiatives, and market position, we assign a "Buy" rating. The company's focus on digital transformation, expansion into new markets, and robust revenue growth provide a solid foundation for future success. Investors should monitor competitive and macroeconomic developments, but Cencosud's prospects appear promising.
