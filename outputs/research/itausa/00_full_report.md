### Executive Summary

Itaúsa S.A. (ticker: ITSA4 on B3) presents a compelling investment opportunity, characterized by a diversified portfolio, consistent revenue streams, and a robust market position. Despite a slight revenue dip in 2024, the company's strategic investments and financial health suggest potential for growth and resilience in volatile markets. This report evaluates Itaúsa's financial performance, market positioning, strategic outlook, and potential risks to provide an investment recommendation.

### Company Overview

Itaúsa S.A. is a Brazilian holding company with investments across various sectors, including finance, infrastructure, and manufacturing. With a history spanning over 50 years, Itaúsa has established itself as Brazil's largest publicly traded holding company, focusing on long-term investments in companies that lead their respective markets.

### Financial Analysis

In 2024, Itaúsa reported a slight decrease in revenue to $1.48 billion USD from $1.49 billion USD in 2023, indicating a minor contraction (Companies Market Cap). However, detailed financial metrics reveal a more nuanced picture. The company's gross profit and net income in 2024 stood at 2,452.00 million BRL and 14,778.00 million BRL, respectively, showcasing substantial profitability (Reuters). The average revenue from 2020 to 2024 was 7.631 billion BRL, highlighting consistent performance over time (Investing.com). Furthermore, Itaúsa's market capitalization and valuation measures, such as a trailing P/E ratio of 8.78, suggest a strong financial foundation and investor confidence (Yahoo Finance, Morningstar).

### Market Position & Competition

Itaúsa holds a dominant position in the Brazilian market, with significant investments in leading companies like Itaú Unibanco, Dexco, and Alpargatas. Its diversified portfolio allows it to mitigate sector-specific risks and capitalize on growth opportunities across different industries. However, the competitive landscape in Brazil is evolving, with new entrants and technological disruptions posing challenges to established players.

### Strategy & Growth Outlook

Itaúsa's growth strategy emphasizes diversification, sustainable investment, and strategic acquisitions. The company's recent performance and portfolio expansion indicate a focus on sectors with strong growth potential, such as financial services, infrastructure, and basic sanitation (Itaúsa Integrated Report). This approach is expected to drive long-term value creation and resilience against economic fluctuations.

### Investment Thesis

Itaúsa presents an attractive investment opportunity due to its diversified portfolio, strong market position, and strategic growth initiatives. The company's financial health and commitment to sustainable investing further enhance its appeal to long-term investors seeking exposure to Brazil's dynamic economy.

### Risks & Concerns

Key risks include economic volatility in Brazil, regulatory changes, and competitive pressures. Additionally, the slight revenue decrease in 2024 warrants monitoring to assess whether it indicates a temporary setback or a longer-term trend. Investors should also consider the impact of global economic uncertainties on Itaúsa's operations and investment valuations.

### Conclusion with Rating

Considering Itaúsa's robust financial performance, strategic positioning, and growth outlook, balanced against potential risks, we assign a "Buy" rating. The company's diversified investment approach and strong market presence position it well to capitalize on Brazil's economic growth, while its financial health provides a buffer against market volatility. Investors should closely monitor economic and regulatory developments in Brazil, as these could impact Itaúsa's performance and investment attractiveness.
