# Project Stack Guardrails (Python-first)

## Purpose & Scope

This repo is **Python 3.11+** and uses **LangGraph + LangChain + Pydantic** (and optional FastAPI).

These guardrails exist because the repository also contains a large cross-domain rules/prompt library (some of which references **.NET/XML** workflows). When there is any ambiguity, **treat Python as the default stack**.

## Guardrails

- **Prefer Python rules** for code changes: `rule.python.*`
- **Prefer pytest** for tests and `tests/` for test code.
- **Prefer Pydantic models** for structured data contracts and agent state.
- **Treat C#/.NET/XML documentation prompts as legacy** unless the user explicitly asks to work on those artifacts (typically within `.cursor/` itself).

## Practical decision rule

If a prompt or rule recommendation conflicts with `.cursorrules` or the actual repo layout (`src/company_researcher/`, `run_research.py`, `docs/`, `deploy/`), follow the repo reality.

## FINAL MUST-PASS CHECKLIST

- [ ] Changes align with the Python/LangGraph stack unless explicitly requested otherwise
- [ ] Any diagnostics are actionable (WHAT/WHY/HOW)
- [ ] No secrets are added or logged
