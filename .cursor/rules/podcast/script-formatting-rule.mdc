# Podcast Script Formatting Standards

## Purpose

Establish professional formatting standards for podcast scripts that optimize readability for performers, ensure consistent production workflow, and maintain quality across recording and editing processes.

## Scope

**Covers**:
- Script structure and layout standards
- Delivery notation and performance cues
- Timing estimation and segmentation
- Production metadata and technical cues
- Accessibility and collaboration features

**Does Not Cover**:
- Content development (see `rule.podcast.authentic-voice-rule`)
- Research methodology (see `rule.podcast.content-research-rule`)
- Audio production techniques beyond script formatting

## When to Apply

Apply when:
- Converting essays or outlines to podcast scripts
- Optimizing scripts for recording performance
- Preparing scripts for editing and post-production
- Ensuring consistency across episode production
- Collaborating with co-hosts or production team

## Core Principles

### 1. Performance-First Design
**Scripts serve the speaker** - Format exists to enhance delivery, not constrain it. Clear visual hierarchy enables natural, engaging performance.

### 2. Production Efficiency
**Streamline workflow** - Standardized formatting reduces editing time and ensures consistent quality across episodes.

### 3. Accessibility Priority
**Multiple users, multiple contexts** - Script must work for performers, editors, collaborators, and future reference.

### 4. Living Document
**Evolve with delivery** - Allow for improvisation while maintaining structure that supports both planned and spontaneous content.

## Script Structure Standards

### Overall Document Organization

#### Header Section (Required)
**Essential Metadata**:
```
EPISODE TITLE: [Full episode title as it will appear]

DESCRIPTION: [2-3 sentence episode summary for internal use]

RUNTIME TARGET: [X] minutes
WORD COUNT: [X] words
SPEAKING RATE: [X] words per minute

CREATED: [Date]
LAST UPDATED: [Date]
VERSION: [X.X]

HOST: [Name(s)]
PRODUCER: [Name]
```

#### Content Sections (Standard Format)
**Segment Organization**:
```
[OPENING MUSIC - X seconds]

**HOST**: [Opening script content]

[Content paragraphs with delivery cues]

[SEGMENT TRANSITION]

**HOST**: [Next segment content]

[Continue pattern throughout]
```

### Content Formatting Standards

#### Text Layout
**Readability Priorities**:
- **Font**: Sans-serif (Arial, Helvetica) 12pt for screen readability
- **Line Spacing**: 1.5 spacing for easy scanning
- **Margins**: 1-inch margins for note-taking space
- **Page Breaks**: Logical breaks at segment transitions, not arbitrary page ends

#### Content Hierarchy
**Visual Structure**:
- **H1**: Episode title (largest, centered)
- **H2**: Major segments (e.g., "Opening", "Main Analysis")
- **H3**: Sub-segments or key topics
- **Bold**: Speaker names, emphasis words
- **Italics**: Internal notes, optional phrases
- **ALL CAPS**: Sound cues, production notes

#### Delivery Notation Standards

##### Performance Cues (Inline)
**Emphasis Indicators**:
- *[WORD]*: Words to emphasize vocally
- **[PAUSE]**: Natural breathing or reflection points (2-3 seconds)
- **[ENERGY UP]**: Increase vocal energy and enthusiasm
- **[SLOWER]**: Slow down for complex ideas (specify duration if needed)

**Delivery Variations**:
- **[WHISPER]**: Speak softly for intimate moments
- **[EXCITED]**: Convey excitement in delivery
- **[SERIOUS]**: Adopt serious tone for important points
- **[QUESTIONING]**: Use questioning intonation

##### Timing and Pacing
**Time Markers**:
- **[X MINUTE MARK]**: Reference points for editing
- **[TIMING NOTE]**: Expected duration for segment
- **[PACE QUICKEN]**: Speed up delivery for building excitement
- **[STRETCH MOMENT]**: Allow flexibility for emotional delivery

##### Engagement Elements
**Audience Interaction Cues**:
- **[DIRECT ADDRESS]**: Speak directly to listener ("You can see...")
- **[RHETORICAL PAUSE]**: Pause for listener reflection (3-5 seconds)
- **[QUESTION PROMPT]**: Pose question expecting listener consideration

### Production and Technical Cues

#### Audio Cues (Standard Format)
**Music and Sound Effects**:
```
[OPENING MUSIC - 15 seconds - "Theme Song V2"]
[BACKGROUND MUSIC IN - subtle, 20% volume]
[SOUND EFFECT - door creaking]
[OUTRO MUSIC - 30 seconds - "Closing Theme"]
[MUSIC FADE OUT - 5 seconds]
```

**Recording Session Notes**:
```
[RECORDING NOTE: Allow natural pause here for emphasis]
[EDIT NOTE: This segment may need tightening in post-production]
[IMPROV NOTE: Feel free to elaborate on this point naturally]
```

#### Voice-Over vs. Conversation Distinction
**Solo Narration**:
```
**HOST**: [Standard script content]
```

**Co-Host Conversation**:
```
**ALEX**: [Host dialogue]
**JORDAN**: [Co-host response]
**ALEX**: [Follow-up]
```

### Timing Estimation Standards

#### Word Count to Time Conversion
**Speaking Rate Guidelines**:
- **Normal Conversation**: 120-150 words per minute
- **Analytical Content**: 110-130 words per minute (allows thinking time)
- **Passionate Delivery**: 130-160 words per minute
- **Complex Technical Content**: 100-120 words per minute

#### Segment Timing Allocation
**Episode Structure Targets**:
- **Opening**: 10-15% of total runtime (hook + context setting)
- **Main Content**: 70-80% of total runtime (analysis + discussion)
- **Closing**: 10-15% of total runtime (conclusion + takeaways)

**Buffer Time**: Always include 10-15% buffer for natural delivery variations, emphasis, and unexpected additions.

### Accessibility and Collaboration Features

#### Editor-Friendly Formatting
**Clear Segmentation**:
- Numbered segments for easy reference
- Consistent transition markers
- Edit point suggestions clearly marked
- Alternative takes noted when applicable

#### Collaboration Support
**Version Control**:
- Clear version numbering in header
- Change tracking when collaborating
- Revision notes for significant changes
- Approval checkpoints for co-hosts

#### Accessibility Features
**Screen Reader Friendly**:
- Semantic heading structure
- Alt text for any images (if included)
- Clear distinction between script and notes
- Consistent formatting patterns

## Failure Modes and Recovery

**Readability Issues**: Script difficult to read during recording
- **Detection**: Performer feedback indicates formatting problems
- **Recovery**: Apply readability standards, increase font size, add line spacing

**Timing Inaccuracy**: Estimated runtime significantly differs from actual
- **Detection**: Recording session shows timing misalignment
- **Recovery**: Refine word count calculations, include appropriate buffers

**Cue Confusion**: Delivery or production cues cause performance disruption
- **Detection**: Recording requires multiple takes due to formatting issues
- **Recovery**: Simplify cue notation, test with performer before full recording

## Provenance Footer Specification

Formatted scripts include production metadata:

```
Produced-by: podcast.script-formatting-rule | words={{count}} | estimated-runtime={{minutes}} | speaking-rate={{wpm}} | ts={{timestamp}}
```

## Tool Integration

**Recommended Script Writing Tools**:
- **Google Docs**: Real-time collaboration, comment system
- **Microsoft Word**: Advanced formatting, track changes
- **Notion**: Database integration, template system
- **Celtx/AWriter**: Dedicated script writing software
- **Markdown Editors**: For version control friendly formatting

**Script Management Workflow**:
1. **Draft**: Initial content creation
2. **Format**: Apply professional formatting standards
3. **Review**: Co-host and producer feedback
4. **Record**: Performer uses formatted script
5. **Archive**: Version-controlled storage for future reference

## Exception Handling

### Non-Standard Episode Formats
**Interview Episodes**: Different cue structure for guest dialogue
**Live Recordings**: Simplified formatting for spontaneous delivery
**Multi-Host Episodes**: Enhanced notation for conversation management

**Adaptation Strategy**:
1. **Maintain Core Standards**: Keep essential formatting elements
2. **Document Variations**: Note format deviations in header
3. **Test in Production**: Verify adapted format works for specific episode type
4. **Update Standards**: Incorporate successful variations into future templates

## Template Examples
