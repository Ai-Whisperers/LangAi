# Podcast Content Research Standards

## Purpose

Establish systematic research methodology ensuring comprehensive, credible content foundation for cinema podcast episodes through multi-source analysis and critical evaluation.

## Scope

**Covers**:
- Research planning and strategy development
- Source collection from multiple media types
- Content evaluation and credibility assessment
- Cross-source analysis and synthesis
- Research documentation and attribution standards

**Does Not Cover**:
- Personal opinion development (see `rule.podcast.authentic-voice-rule`)
- Script writing and formatting (see `rule.podcast.script-formatting-rule`)
- Recording and production techniques

## When to Apply

Apply when:
- Planning new podcast episode research
- Collecting sources from YouTube, blogs, or academic materials
- Evaluating source credibility and relevance
- Synthesizing multiple perspectives on cinema topics
- Ensuring research comprehensiveness before content creation

## Core Principles

### 1. Multi-Source Verification
**Never rely on single source** - Cross-reference information across at least 3 different sources before forming conclusions.

### 2. Credibility Hierarchy
**Prioritize expertise** - Weight sources by creator credibility, publication quality, and demonstrated expertise in cinema analysis.

### 3. Perspective Diversity
**Seek balanced viewpoints** - Include sources representing different critical perspectives, time periods, and analytical approaches.

### 4. Attribution Transparency
**Credit all sources** - Maintain clear documentation of source origins and properly attribute ideas during episode delivery.

## Research Process Standards

### Phase 1: Research Planning (Pre-Collection)

#### Episode Research Scope Definition
- **Topic Boundaries**: Clearly define film, director, genre, or concept scope
- **Research Questions**: Identify 3-5 key questions episode must answer
- **Source Type Requirements**: Specify minimum sources per category (YouTube, blogs, academic)
- **Quality Thresholds**: Define minimum credibility standards per source type

#### Research Timeline Planning
- **Phase Duration**: Allocate realistic time for each research phase
- **Milestone Deadlines**: Set intermediate deadlines for source collection completion
- **Contingency Time**: Include buffer for unexpected research depth requirements

### Phase 2: Source Collection (Active Research)

#### YouTube Source Standards
**Credibility Assessment**:
- Channel subscriber count (>10K for established creators)
- Content consistency and production quality
- Creator credentials (film education, professional experience)
- Citation practices and source attribution

**Collection Strategy**:
- Minimum 5-7 analysis videos per major topic
- Mix of established creators and fresh perspectives
- Include dissenting viewpoints when available
- Document specific timestamps for key insights

#### Written Source Standards
**Publication Hierarchy**:
- **Tier 1**: Academic journals, university publications, peer-reviewed analysis
- **Tier 2**: Professional film criticism (New York Times, professional publications)
- **Tier 3**: Specialized film blogs, technical analysis sites
- **Tier 4**: General audience blogs, fan analysis (supplemental only)

**Quality Criteria**:
- Author credentials and expertise clearly stated
- Publication date within last 10 years (unless historical analysis)
- Clear methodology and evidence-based claims
- Absence of promotional content or conflicts of interest

#### Source Diversity Requirements
- **Perspective Range**: Include at least 3 different analytical approaches
- **Time Period Coverage**: Sources from different eras when relevant
- **Cultural Context**: Include non-Western perspectives when applicable
- **Critical Spectrum**: Balance positive, negative, and nuanced assessments

### Phase 3: Content Analysis (Post-Collection)

#### Cross-Source Synthesis
**Pattern Identification**:
- Common themes across multiple sources
- Points of critical consensus and disagreement
- Evolution of critical reception over time
- Cultural impact indicators

**Gap Analysis**:
- Topics not adequately covered by collected sources
- Contradictions requiring resolution
- Areas needing additional research
- Opportunities for original analysis

#### Credibility Weighting
**Source Authority Scoring**:
- **High Authority**: Academic sources, established critics, primary sources
- **Medium Authority**: Professional journalists, specialized analysts
- **Low Authority**: General audience content, unverified claims

**Consensus Building**:
- Weight high-authority sources more heavily in final analysis
- Note when consensus exists vs. active debate
- Identify minority viewpoints warranting exploration

### Phase 4: Research Documentation

#### Source Inventory Requirements
**Complete Metadata**:
- Full source titles and creators/authors
- Publication dates and platforms
- Direct URLs or access information
- Creator credentials and background
- Key insights summary (3-5 bullet points per source)

#### Attribution Standards
**Citation Format**:
- In-script attribution: "As film critic Roger Ebert noted..."
- Source credibility context: "...in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times..."
- Multiple perspective framing: "While some critics focus on..., others emphasize..."

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Pre-Research Validation
- [ ] Research scope clearly defined with boundaries
- [ ] Key research questions articulated
- [ ] Source type requirements specified
- [ ] Quality thresholds established
- [ ] Realistic timeline created

### Source Collection Validation
- [ ] Minimum source counts met per category

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Research Shortcuts
- **Single Source Reliance**: Never base episode on one video or article
- **Recency Bias**: Don't prioritize recent content over established expertise
- **Confirmation Bias**: Actively seek sources challenging your preconceptions

### ❌ Credibility Compromises
- **Authority Inflation**: Don't present fan analysis as expert opinion
- **Context Omission**: Always provide source credibility context to listeners
- **Bias Concealment**: Transparently note potential conflicts of interest

### ❌ Attribution Failures
- **Source Plagiarism**: Never present others' ideas as your own
- **Vague Citations**: Always provide specific source context
- **Over-Attribution**: Don't interrupt flow with excessive citation details

## Success Metrics

- **Source Diversity Score**: Percentage of different perspectives represented
- **Authority Balance**: Ratio of high/medium/low credibility sources
- **Research Depth**: Average insights per source (target: 3-5 key points)
- **Gap Coverage**: Percentage of identified gaps addressed
