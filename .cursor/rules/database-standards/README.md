# SQL Development Standards

This repository contains the standards and guidelines for SQL development across our products. These standards ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality in our database code.

## Standards Documents

- [General Standards](general-standards.md) - Repository structure, version control, naming conventions, and general best practices
- [Database Standards](database-standards.md) - MSSQL-specific standards and Oracle phase-out guidelines
- [Development Workflow](development-workflow.md) - Development process, testing requirements, and deployment procedures
- [SQL Coding Standards](sql-coding-standards.md) - SQL coding style, best practices, and performance guidelines
- [Template Usage](template-usage.md) - Guidelines for using SQL templates and creating new ones
- [Tracking Standards](tracking-standards.md) - Requirements for version tracking, documentation, and Excel tracking sheet

## Key Principles

1. **Consistency** - Follow established patterns and conventions
2. **Maintainability** - Write code that is easy to understand and modify
3. **Performance** - Optimize for efficiency and scalability
4. **Documentation** - Document all changes and maintain up-to-date documentation
5. **Testing** - Thoroughly test all changes before deployment
6. **Version Control** - Properly track and document all versions
7. **Dependency Management** - Clearly document and validate module dependencies

## Getting Started

1. Review the [General Standards](general-standards.md) for an overview
2. Understand the [Development Workflow](development-workflow.md) for your process
3. Follow the [SQL Coding Standards](sql-coding-standards.md) when writing code
4. Use appropriate [Templates](template-usage.md) for common operations
5. Adhere to [Database Standards](database-standards.md) for technology-specific guidelines
6. Follow [Tracking Standards](tracking-standards.md) for version control and documentation

5. Update the Excel tracking sheet with all changes

## Questions and Feedback

For questions or feedback about these standards, please contact the database team lead.

## Quick Reference

- Current Release: R970
- Primary Database: MSSQL
- Oracle Status: Being phased out
- Template Location: `/Templates/MSSQL/` and `/Templates/Oracle/`

## Standards Evolution

These standards are living documents that evolve with our development practices. They are based on:
- Current best practices (R970)
- Team experience
- Industry standards
- Tool capabilities (Cursor AI, etc.)

## Contributing to Standards

When suggesting changes to these standards:
1. Document the rationale
2. Provide examples
3. Consider impact on existing code
4. Get team review and approval
