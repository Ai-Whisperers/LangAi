# No Inventions Rule

## Purpose & Scope

This rule restricts the AI from inventing changes or adding features that were not explicitly requested by the user.

**Applies to**: All code generation and modification tasks.

## Inputs (Contract)

- User request defining scope of change
- Existing code context

## Outputs (Contract)

- Code changes limited strictly to the requested scope
- No unrequested refactoring, formatting, or "improvements"

## Deterministic Steps

1. Analyze user request to identify explicit scope.
2. Identify minimal changes required to fulfill request.
3. Reject any changes that fall outside this scope (unless necessary for correctness).
4. Apply changes.

## Formatting Requirements

None.

## OPSEC and Leak Control

## Integration Points
