# README Structure Rule

## Purpose & Scope

This rule defines the standard structure for README.md files to ensure consistency and completeness across projects.

**Applies to**: Root `README.md` and module-level `README.md`.

## Inputs (Contract)

- Project/Module Name
- Description
- Setup/Usage instructions

## Outputs (Contract)

- Well-structured `README.md`

## Deterministic Steps

1. Create/Update `README.md`.
2. Ensure required sections exist:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Installation/Setup
   - Usage
   - Contribution
   - Link back to root README when this is a module-level README
3. Use clear markdown formatting.
4. Scope placement:
   - Exactly one README at the project root.
   - Add module-level READMEs only when the module/package is an entry point or is consumed independently.
   - Keep module-level READMEs concise and point back to the root README for shared information.

## Formatting Requirements

- Top-level H1 for Title
- H2 for main sections
- Badges (optional) at top

## OPSEC and Leak Control

- No internal secrets in README.

## Integration Points

- Enforced by repo validation (lint/CI/pre-commit) to fail when governed roots/modules are missing a README.md or required sections.
- For Visual Studio solutions, root README may be included as a Solution Item; avoid duplicating content—use CI/pre-commit to enforce instead.
