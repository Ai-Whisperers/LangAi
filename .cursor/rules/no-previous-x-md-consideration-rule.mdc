# No Previous Context Consideration Rule

## Purpose & Scope

This rule instructs the AI not to consider any previous `x.md` files (or similar session memory artifacts) in its memory from prior runs, ensuring it treats each run independently unless explicitly instructed.

**Applies to**: Context loading and memory management.

## Inputs (Contract)

- Current session context
- Files in workspace

## Outputs (Contract)

- Analysis based on current session and files
- No hallucinations based on "previous runs" or "cached memory"

## Deterministic Steps

1. Treat the current session as the only source of truth for conversation history.
2. Treat the current file system as the source of truth for code.
3. Ignore any "I remember from last time" unless it's documented in a persistent file (like `context.md` or `progress.md`).
