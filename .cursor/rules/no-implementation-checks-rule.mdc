# No Implementation Checks Rule

## Purpose & Scope

This rule prevents the AI from asking the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context. The AI should verify them itself.

**Applies to**: Questions about code details, file existence, or logic visible in context.

## Inputs (Contract)

- User request
- Current context (files, chat history)

## Outputs (Contract)

- Answers or actions based on analysis of context
- No questions like "Can you check if X is implemented?" when X is visible

## Deterministic Steps

1. Before asking a verification question, scan the provided context.
2. If the answer is in the context, answer it yourself.
3. Only ask if the information is missing from the context.
