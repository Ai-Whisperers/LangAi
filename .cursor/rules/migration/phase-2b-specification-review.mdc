## Failure Modes and Recovery

### Failure Mode 1: Critical Issues Cannot Be Resolved

**Detection**: Review identifies showstopper issues with no clear resolution path

**Impact**: Cannot proceed to Phase 3, project delays, potential scope changes

**Recovery**:
1. Escalate to project steering committee immediately
2. Facilitate technical working sessions with all relevant experts
3. Consider alternative approaches or scope adjustments
4. Obtain executive decision on path forward
5. Document decision rationale and update specifications accordingly

**Prevention**: Early technical prototyping, expert consultation during Phase 2, regular stakeholder checkpoints

### Failure Mode 2: Stakeholder Disagreement on Business Logic

**Detection**: Business and technical reviewers have conflicting interpretations

**Impact**: Specification approval blocked, unclear implementation guidance

**Recovery**:
1. Document all perspectives with supporting evidence
2. Trace back to Phase 1 source code as single source of truth
3. Facilitate joint session with both parties and Phase 1 analysts
4. Test actual C++ system behavior if accessible
5. Obtain executive decision if technical evidence inconclusive

**Prevention**: Business stakeholder involvement in Phase 1 and 2, early ambiguity resolution

### Failure Mode 3: Development Team Declares Specifications Unimplementable

**Detection**: Implementation review identifies technical impossibilities or blockers

**Impact**: Cannot proceed to implementation, major specification rework required

**Recovery**:
1. Identify specific technical barriers with detailed analysis
2. Conduct technical spike or proof-of-concept to validate concerns
3. Engage C# technology experts for alternative approaches
4. Update specifications with feasible technical approach
5. Re-review updated specifications for implementation readiness

**Prevention**: Development team involvement in Phase 2, early technical validation, C# expertise consultation

### Failure Mode 4: External Integration Compatibility Issues

**Detection**: Integration review reveals breaking changes to external system interfaces

**Impact**: Cannot maintain compatibility, external system coordination required

**Recovery**:
1. Document all compatibility issues with impact assessment
2. Engage external system owners immediately
3. Design adapter layer or translation mechanisms
4. Plan coordinated deployment strategy
5. Update integration specifications with mitigation approach

**Prevention**: External system involvement in Phase 2, early interface validation, compatibility testing

### Failure Mode 5: Review Process Stalls Due to Stakeholder Unavailability

**Detection**: Review deadlines missed, stakeholders not responding

**Impact**: Project delays, timeline at risk, momentum lost

**Recovery**:
1. Escalate to project manager and stakeholder managers
2. Identify backup reviewers if primary unavailable
3. Adjust review schedule with realistic availability
4. Consider breaking review into smaller, more manageable sessions
5. Obtain management commitment to reviewer availability

**Prevention**: Stakeholder commitment secured upfront, backup reviewers identified, review time blocked on calendars
