# Verify Information Rule

## Purpose & Scope

This rule ensures that the AI always verifies information before presenting it, avoiding assumptions and speculation.

**Applies to**: Fact-checking, code analysis, debugging.

## Inputs (Contract)

- Question or task
- Available context

## Outputs (Contract)

- Verified facts
- No "I assume" or "It should be" statements without evidence

## Deterministic Steps

1. Identify assertions to be made.
2. Check context for evidence supporting each assertion.
3. If evidence is missing, check files or search.
4. If still missing, state "I do not know" or "I cannot verify". Do not guess.
