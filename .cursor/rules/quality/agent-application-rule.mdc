# Quality Standards - Agent Application Rule

## Purpose

This rule guides AI agents on when and how to apply quality standards rules for maintaining zero warnings and zero errors discipline across all development work.

## When to Apply Quality Rules

### Explicit Triggers

Apply quality rules when the user's request involves:

- Running pre-commit validation checks
- Fixing warnings or errors in code
- Setting up quality gates or validation scripts
- Enforcing code quality standards before commits
- Configuring linters, formatters, or analyzers
- Implementing CI/CD quality checks
- Reviewing code for quality compliance
- Creating or updating validation scripts

### Context Clues

Apply quality rules when you observe:

- User preparing to commit code (git add, git commit in context)
- Linter warnings or compiler errors in terminal output
- Discussion of build failures or test failures
- Questions about code quality or validation
- Setting up new projects or standardizing quality practices
- Fixing technical debt or quality issues
- Code review discussions mentioning warnings/errors

### DO NOT Apply When

- User is only reading/viewing code (read-only operations)
- Request is about documentation or comments only (unless enforcing doc standards)
- Working on experimental/prototype code not intended for commit
- Explicitly working in a draft/WIP branch where quality gates are deferred

## How to Apply Quality Rules

### 1. Assess the Request

Determine which aspect of quality standards is involved:

- **Pre-commit validation**: Running checks before git commit → use `rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1`
- **Quality gate setup**: Configuring validation infrastructure → use `rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1` (implementation patterns)
- **Fixing quality issues**: Addressing warnings/errors → use `rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1` (handling section)
- **Overall quality discipline**: Understanding standards → use `rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1`

### 2. Load Required Rules

```yaml
# For pre-commit validation workflow
requires:
  - rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1

# For quality gate setup
requires:
  - rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1

# For fixing quality issues
requires:
  - rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1
```

### 3. Execute with Validation

When enforcing quality standards:

1. **Verify validation tools available** - Check for linters, compilers, test runners
2. **Run comprehensive validation** - Execute all applicable quality checks
3. **Report all issues clearly** - Show warnings/errors with context
4. **Guide fixes systematically** - Prioritize errors, then warnings
5. **Re-validate after fixes** - Confirm zero warnings/errors
6. **Only then allow commit** - Block commit until clean state achieved

### 4. Provide Contextual Guidance

Always explain:

- **Why** quality gates matter (prevention over remediation)
- **What** checks are being run and why each matters
- **How** to fix specific warnings/errors efficiently
- **When** validation should be run (before every commit)

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Preparing to Commit

```
User: "Ready to commit these changes"

Agent Actions:
1. Load rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1
2. Check if validation has been run recently
3. Recommend: Run validation before committing
4. Provide: Specific validation commands for project type
5. Explain: "Zero warnings, zero errors before every commit"
6. Wait: For validation to pass before allowing commit
```

### Scenario 2: User Encounters Warnings/Errors

```
User: "Getting some warnings when I build"

Agent Actions:
1. Load rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1
2. Review warning messages in context
3. Categorize: Errors vs warnings, priority levels
4. Provide: Specific fix guidance or auto-fix commands
5. Guide: Through systematic resolution
6. Validate: Confirm fixes resolve all issues
```

### Scenario 3: Setting Up Quality Infrastructure

```
User: "How do I set up pre-commit validation?"

Agent Actions:
1. Load rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1
2. Identify project type (.NET, Python, JS, etc.)
3. Provide: Appropriate validation script pattern
4. Explain: Validation categories and tools needed
5. Guide: Git hooks or CI/CD integration
6. Test: Validation script works correctly
```

### Scenario 4: Quality Gate Failure

```
User: "Build failed in CI with warnings"

Agent Actions:
1. Load rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1
2. Analyze: CI output for specific warnings/errors
3. Explain: Why quality gate blocked build
4. Provide: Commands to reproduce locally
5. Guide: Through fixes and re-validation
6. Confirm: Local validation passes before pushing
```

## Integration with Other Rules

### Ticket System Integration

When both ticket and quality rules apply:

```yaml
requires:
  - rule.ticket.validation-before-completion.v1
  - rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1
```

Example: Ticket cannot be marked complete unless quality validation passes.

### Git Workflow Integration

When committing code:

```yaml
requires:
  - rule.git.branch-lifecycle.v1
  - rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1
  - rule.development.commit-message.v1
```

Example: Pre-commit validation required before git commit.

### CI/CD Integration

When building or deploying:

```yaml
requires:
  - rule.cicd.pre-build-validation.v1
  - rule.quality.zero-warnings-errors.v1
```

Example: Local validation mirrors remote CI/CD checks.

## Quality Standards

### Always Provide

- ✅ Specific validation commands for project type
- ✅ Clear categorization of issues (errors vs warnings)
- ✅ Prioritized fix guidance (errors first, then warnings)
- ✅ Re-validation confirmation after fixes
- ✅ Explanation of why zero-tolerance matters

### Never Do

- ❌ Allow commits with warnings or errors
- ❌ Suggest "fixing later" or "TODO" markers for quality issues
- ❌ Disable quality checks to make validation pass
- ❌ Skip validation "just this once"
- ❌ Comment out failing tests or suppress legitimate warnings

## Tool-Specific Guidance

### .NET Projects

```powershell
# Validation sequence
dotnet restore
dotnet build /warnaserror
dotnet format --verify-no-changes
dotnet test --no-build

# Common fix: missing XML docs
# Action: Add XML documentation to public members
```

### Python Projects

```bash
# Validation sequence
flake8 .
pylint src/
mypy src/
black --check .
pytest

# Common fix: linting issues
# Action: Run black --format . for auto-fix
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Projects

```bash
# Validation sequence
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run format:check
npm test

# Common fix: formatting
# Action: Run npm run format for auto-fix
```

## FINAL MUST-PASS CHECKLIST

When applying quality rules, verify:

- [ ] Validation tools identified and available for project type
- [ ] All applicable validation checks have been run
- [ ] All errors and warnings reported clearly with context
- [ ] Fix guidance provided systematically (prioritized)
- [ ] Re-validation confirms zero warnings/errors
- [ ] Commit blocked until clean state achieved
- [ ] User understands why quality discipline matters
