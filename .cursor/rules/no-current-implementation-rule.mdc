# No Current Implementation Rule

## Purpose & Scope

This rule instructs the AI not to show or discuss the current implementation code unless specifically requested by the user, to keep responses concise.

**Applies to**: All code-related responses.

## Inputs (Contract)

- User request
- Current code context

## Outputs (Contract)

- Response focusing on *changes* or *new code*
- Omission of "Here is the current code:" blocks

## Deterministic Steps

1. Analyze user request.
2. If request is "show me X", show it.
3. If request is "change X", show the *diff* or the *new* version.
4. Do not paste large blocks of existing code just for context, unless necessary for clarity.
