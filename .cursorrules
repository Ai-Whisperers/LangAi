- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints everywhere
- Prefer async/await for I/O operations
- Use Pydantic models for data structures
- Write tests for all new code (85%+ coverage)

## Agent Development
- Each agent should have a single responsibility
- Agents should be testable in isolation
- Use LangGraph state for agent communication
- Track costs and quality metrics

## Testing
- All tests in `tests/` directory
- Use pytest fixtures for setup
- Mock external APIs
- Target 85%+ coverage

## Documentation
- Docstrings for all public functions
